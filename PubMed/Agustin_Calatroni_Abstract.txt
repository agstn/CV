BACKGROUND: Whether children and people with asthma and allergic diseases are at 
increased risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
infection is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: Our aims were to determine the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 
households with children and to also determine whether self-reported asthma 
and/or other allergic diseases are associated with infection and household 
transmission.
METHODS: For 6 months, biweekly nasal swabs and weekly surveys were conducted 
within 1394 households (N = 4142 participants) to identify incident SARS-CoV-2 
infections from May 2020 to February 2021, which was the pandemic period largely 
before a vaccine and before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Participant 
and household infection and household transmission probabilities were calculated 
by using time-to-event analyses, and factors associated with infection and 
transmission risk were determined by using regression analyses.
RESULTS: In all, 147 households (261 participants) tested positive for 
SARS-CoV-2. The household SARS-CoV-2 infection probability was 25.8%; the 
participant infection probability was similar for children (14.0% [95% CI = 
8.0%-19.6%]), teenagers (12.1% [95% CI = 8.2%-15.9%]), and adults (14.0% [95% 
CI = 9.5%-18.4%]). Infections were symptomatic in 24.5% of children, 41.2% of 
teenagers, and 62.5% of adults. Self-reported doctor-diagnosed asthma was not a 
risk factor for infection (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.04 [95% CI = 
0.73-1.46]), nor was upper respiratory allergy or eczema. Self-reported 
doctor-diagnosed food allergy was associated with lower infection risk (aHR = 
0.50 [95% CI = 0.32-0.81]); higher body mass index was associated with increased 
infection risk (aHR per 10-point increase = 1.09 [95% CI = 1.03-1.15]). The 
household secondary attack rate was 57.7%. Asthma was not associated with 
household transmission, but transmission was lower in households with food 
allergy (adjusted odds ratio = 0.43 [95% CI = 0.19-0.96]; P = .04).
CONCLUSION: Asthma does not increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Food 
allergy is associated with lower infection risk, whereas body mass index is 
associated with increased infection risk. Understanding how these factors modify 
infection risk may offer new avenues for preventing infection.

BACKGROUND: Seasonal variation in respiratory illnesses and exacerbations in 
pediatric populations with asthma is well described, though whether upper airway 
microbes play season-specific roles in these events is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that nasal microbiota composition is seasonally 
dynamic and that discrete microbe-host interactions modify risk of asthma 
exacerbation in a season-specific manner.
METHODS: Repeated nasal samples from children with exacerbation-prone asthma 
collected during periods of respiratory health (baseline; n = 181 samples) or 
first captured respiratory illness (n = 97) across all seasons, underwent 
bacterial (16S ribosomal RNA gene) and fungal (internal transcribed spacer 
region 2) biomarker sequencing. Virus detection was performed by multiplex PCR. 
Paired nasal transcriptome data were examined for seasonal dynamics and 
integrative analyses.
RESULTS: Upper airway bacterial and fungal microbiota and rhinovirus detection 
exhibited significant seasonal dynamics. In seasonally adjusted analysis, 
variation in both baseline and respiratory illness microbiota related to 
subsequent exacerbation. Specifically, in the fall, when respiratory illness and 
exacerbation events were most frequent, several Moraxella and Haemophilus 
members were enriched both in virus-positive respiratory illnesses and those 
that progressed to exacerbations. The abundance of 2 discrete bacterial 
networks, characteristically comprising either Streptococcus or Staphylococcus, 
exhibited opposing interactions with an exacerbation-associated SMAD3 nasal 
epithelial transcriptional module to significantly increase the odds of 
subsequent exacerbation (odds ratio = 14.7, 95% confidence interval = 1.50-144, 
P = .02; odds ratio = 39.17, 95% confidence interval = 2.44-626, P = .008, 
respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Upper airway microbiomes covary with season and with seasonal 
trends in respiratory illnesses and asthma exacerbations. Seasonally adjusted 
analyses reveal specific bacteria-host interactions that significantly increase 
risk of asthma exacerbation in these children.

BACKGROUND: Characterization of allergic responses to cockroach (CR), a common 
aeroallergen associated with asthma, has focused mainly on IgE reactivity, but 
little is known about T cell responses, particularly in children. We conducted a 
functional evaluation of CR allergen-specific T cell reactivity in a cohort of 
CR allergic children with asthma.
METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from 71 
children, with mild-to-moderate asthma who were enrolled in a CR immunotherapy 
(IT) clinical trial, prior to treatment initiation. PBMC were stimulated with 
peptide pools derived from 11 CR allergens, and CD4+ T cell responses assessed 
by intracellular cytokine staining.
RESULTS: Highly heterogeneous responses in T cell reactivity were observed among 
participants, both in terms of the magnitude of cytokine response and allergen 
immunodominance. Reactivity against Bla g 9 and Bla g 5 was most frequent. The 
phenotype of the T cell response was dominated by IL-4 production and a Th2 
polarized profile in 54.9% of participants, but IFNγ production and Th1 
polarization was observed in 25.3% of the participants. The numbers of 
regulatory CD4+ T cells were also highly variable and the magnitude of effector 
responses and Th2 polarization were positively correlated with serum IgE levels 
specific to a clinical CR extract.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that in children with mild-to-moderate 
asthma, CR-specific T cell responses display a wide range of magnitude, allergen 
dominance, and polarization. These results will enable examination of whether 
any of the variables measured are affected by IT and/or are predictive of 
clinical outcomes.

T-regulatory cells (Tregs) play a key role in suppressing effector cells and 
maintaining self-tolerance. Studies of younger adults and children suggest that 
insufficient differentiation and functional defects of Tregs may contribute to 
the development of asthma; however, data from older patients with asthma are 
limited. To address the effects of aging on the relationship of Treg frequency 
and function with clinical outcomes, we collected induced sputum (differential 
cell count and Treg frequency) and peripheral blood (Treg function and 
frequency) from aged (> 60 years of age) and younger (20-40 years old) patients 
with asthma. In younger patients, low Treg suppression was associated with 
significantly higher mean numbers of emergency department (ED) (1.8 vs. 0.17, P 
= 0.02) and urgent care visits (2.3 vs. 0.17, P = 0.01) for asthma, and 
decreased asthma control (mean Asthma Control Test [ACT] score, 17 vs. 21.3, P = 
0.01) compared to those with high Treg suppression. In older patients, however, 
a lower Treg function was not significantly associated with ACT scores (18.2 vs. 
13.4, P = 0.10), or the number of ED (P = 0.9) or urgent care visits (P = 0.2). 
Our data suggest that Tregs have a weak relationship with asthma control and 
clinical asthma outcomes in older patients and differ from findings in younger 
patients, where Tregs are more likely to play a protective role.

BACKGROUND: A relationship between adiposity and asthma has been described in 
some cohort studies, but little is known about trajectories of adiposity 
throughout early childhood among children at high risk for developing asthma in 
urban United States cities. Moreover, early life trajectories of adipokines that 
have metabolic and immunologic properties have not been comprehensively 
investigated.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to characterize trajectories of adiposity in a 
longitudinal birth cohort of predominately Black and Latinx children (n = 418) 
using several different repeated measures including body mass index (BMI) z 
score, bioimpedance analysis, leptin, and adiponectin in the first 10 years of 
life.
METHODS: In a longitudinal birth cohort of predominately Black and Latinx 
children, we used repeated annual measures of BMI, bioimpedance analysis (ie, 
percentage of body fat), leptin, and adiponectin to create trajectories across 
the first 10 years of life. Across those trajectories, we compared asthma 
diagnosis and multiple lung function outcomes, including spirometry, impulse 
oscillometry, and methacholine response.
RESULTS: Three trajectories were observed for BMI z score, bioimpedance 
analysis, and leptin and 2 for adiponectin. There was no association between 
trajectories of BMI, percentage of body fat, leptin, or adipokine and asthma 
diagnosis or lung function (P > .05).
CONCLUSIONS: Trajectories of adiposity were not associated with asthma or lung 
function in children at high risk for developing asthma. Risk factors related to 
geography as well as social and demographic factors unique to specific 
populations could explain the lack of association and should be considered in 
obesity and asthma studies.

BACKGROUND: Black and Hispanic children growing up in disadvantaged urban 
neighborhoods have the highest rates of asthma and related morbidity in the 
United States.
OBJECTIVES: This study sought to identify specific respiratory phenotypes of 
health and disease in this population, associations with early life exposures, 
and molecular patterns of gene expression in nasal epithelial cells that 
underlie clinical disease.
METHODS: The study population consisted of 442 high-risk urban children who had 
repeated assessments of wheezing, allergen-specific IgE, and lung function 
through 10 years of age. Phenotypes were identified by developing temporal 
trajectories for these data, and then compared to early life exposures and 
patterns of nasal epithelial gene expression at 11 years of age.
RESULTS: Of the 6 identified respiratory phenotypes, a high wheeze, high atopy, 
low lung function group had the greatest respiratory morbidity. In early life, 
this group had low exposure to common allergens and high exposure to ergosterol 
in house dust. While all high-atopy groups were associated with increased 
expression of a type-2 inflammation gene module in nasal epithelial samples, an 
epithelium IL-13 response module tracked closely with impaired lung function, 
and a MUC5AC hypersecretion module was uniquely upregulated in the high wheeze, 
high atopy, low lung function group. In contrast, a medium wheeze, low atopy 
group showed altered expression of modules of epithelial integrity, epithelial 
injury, and antioxidant pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: In the first decade of life, high-risk urban children develop 
distinct phenotypes of respiratory health versus disease that link early life 
environmental exposures to childhood allergic sensitization and asthma. 
Moreover, unique patterns of airway gene expression demonstrate how specific 
molecular pathways underlie distinct respiratory phenotypes, including allergic 
and nonallergic asthma.

BACKGROUND: Prenatal and early-life exposure to maternal stress and depression 
is linked to development of recurrent wheezing in young children.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether maternal stress and depression in 
early life are associated with nonatopic wheezing phenotype in urban children.
METHODS: The Urban Environment and Childhood Asthma Study examined a birth 
cohort of children at high risk for asthma in low-income neighborhoods. Prenatal 
and postnatal (through age 3 years) maternal stress and depression scores were 
compared with respiratory phenotypes through age 10 years (multinomial 
regression), self-reported colds (linear regression), and detection of 
respiratory viruses (Poisson regression).
RESULTS: Scores for maternal depression, and, to a lesser extent, maternal 
perceived stress, were positively related to multiple wheezing phenotypes. In 
particular, cumulative measures of maternal depression in the first 3 years were 
related to the moderate-wheeze-low-atopy phenotype (odds ratio, 1.13; [1.05, 
1.21]; P < .01). Considering indicators of respiratory health that were used to 
identify the phenotypes, there were multiple positive associations between 
early-life scores for maternal stress and depression and increased wheezing 
illnesses, but no consistent relationships with lung function and some inverse 
relationships with allergic sensitization. Cumulative maternal stress and 
depression scores were associated with cumulative number of respiratory 
illnesses through age 3 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Among high-risk, urban children, maternal stress and depression in 
early life were positively associated with respiratory illnesses and a 
moderate-wheeze-low-atopy phenotype. These results suggest that treating stress 
and depression in expectant and new mothers could reduce viral respiratory 
illnesses and recurrent wheeze during the preschool years and some forms of 
childhood asthma.

Staphylococcus aureus colonizes patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) and 
exacerbates disease by promoting inflammation. The present study investigated 
the safety and mechanisms of action of Staphylococcus hominis A9 (ShA9), a 
bacterium isolated from healthy human skin, as a topical therapy for AD. ShA9 
killed S. aureus on the skin of mice and inhibited expression of a toxin from S. 
aureus (psmα) that promotes inflammation. A first-in-human, phase 1, 
double-blinded, randomized 1-week trial of topical ShA9 or vehicle on the 
forearm skin of 54 adults with S. aureus-positive AD (NCT03151148) met its 
primary endpoint of safety, and participants receiving ShA9 had fewer adverse 
events associated with AD. Eczema severity was not significantly different when 
evaluated in all participants treated with ShA9 but a significant decrease in S. 
aureus and increased ShA9 DNA were seen and met secondary endpoints. Some S. 
aureus strains on participants were not directly killed by ShA9, but expression 
of mRNA for psmα was inhibited in all strains. Improvement in local eczema 
severity was suggested by post-hoc analysis of participants with S. aureus 
directly killed by ShA9. These observations demonstrate the safety and potential 
benefits of bacteriotherapy for AD.

BACKGROUND: Perennial aeroallergen sensitization is associated with greater 
asthma morbidity and is required for treatment with omalizumab.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the predictive relationship between the number of 
aeroallergen sensitizations, total serum IgE, and serum eosinophil count, and 
response to omalizumab in children and adolescents with asthma treated during 
the fall season.
METHODS: This analysis includes inner-city patients with persistent asthma and 
recent exacerbations aged 6-20 years comprising the placebo- and 
omalizumab-treated groups in 2 completed randomized clinical trials, the 
Inner-City Anti-IgE Therapy for Asthma study and the Preventative Omalizumab or 
Step-Up Therapy for Fall Exacerbations study. Logistic regression modeled the 
relationship between greater degrees of markers of allergic inflammation and the 
primary outcome of fall season asthma exacerbations.
RESULTS: The analysis included 761 participants who were 62% male and 59% 
African American with a median age of 10 years. Fall asthma exacerbations were 
significantly higher in children with greater numbers of aeroallergen-specific 
sensitizations in the placebo group (odds ratio [OR], 1.33; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 1.11-1.60; P < .01), but not in the omalizumab-treated children 
(OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.91-1.28; P = .37), indicating a significant differential 
effect (P < .01). Likewise, there was a differential effect of omalizumab 
treatment in children with greater baseline total serum IgE levels (P < .01) or 
greater baseline serum eosinophil counts (P < .01). Multiple aeroallergen 
sensitization was the best predictor of response to omalizumab; treated 
participants sensitized to ≥4 different groups of aeroallergens had a 51% 
reduction in the odds of a fall exacerbation (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.30-0.81; P < 
.01).
CONCLUSIONS: In preventing fall season asthma exacerbations, treatment with 
omalizumab was most beneficial in children with a greater degree of allergic 
inflammation.

BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) and food allergy (FA) are associated with 
skin barrier dysfunction.
OBJECTIVE: Skin biomarkers are needed for skin barrier interventions studies.
METHODS: In this study, skin tape strip (STS) samples were collected from 
nonlesional skin of 62 children in AD FA+, AD FA-, and nonatopic groups for mass 
spectrometry proteomic analysis. transepidermal water loss and allergic 
sensitization were assessed. STS proteomic analysis results were validated in an 
independent cohort of 41 adults with AD with and without FA versus nonatopic 
controls.
RESULTS: A group of 45 proteins was identified as a principal component 1 (PC1) 
with the highest expression in AD FA+ STSs. This novel set of STS proteins was 
highly correlative to skin transepidermal water loss and allergic sensitization. 
PC1 proteins included keratin intermediate filaments; proteins associated with 
inflammatory responses (S100 proteins, alarmins, protease inhibitors); and 
glycolysis and antioxidant defense enzymes. Analysis of PC1 proteins expression 
in an independent adult AD cohort validated differential expression of STS PC1 
proteins in the skin of adult patients with AD with the history of clinical 
reactions to peanut.
CONCLUSIONS: STS analysis of nonlesional skin of AD children identified a 
cluster of proteins with the highest expression in AD FA+ children. The 
differential expression of STS PC1 proteins was confirmed in a replicate cohort 
of adult AD patients with FA to peanut, suggesting a unique STS proteomic 
endotype for AD FA+ that persists into adulthood. Collectively, PC1 proteins are 
associated with abnormalities in skin barrier integrity and may increase the 
risk of epicutaneous sensitization to food allergens.

In a sub-study of a clinical trial (NCT01737710) investigating the 
immunogenicity of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) administered 
intradermally or intramuscularly to individuals with atopic dermatitis (AD), we 
assessed T cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) responses to influenza B in AD 
and Non-AD controls. The comparison of IFN-γ ELISpot in 58 AD and 31 Non-AD 
showed lower responses in AD pre-vaccination. Pre-vaccination, AD also had lower 
Th2 responses and less inflammatory cytokine production by APC measured by flow 
cytometry and cytokine levels in culture supernatants. AD also had lower Th1 and 
Th2 responses to nonspecific anti-CD3/anti-CD28-stimulation, but these were not 
significantly correlated with the influenza-specific responses, suggesting a 
primary role for the APC in the decreased influenza-specific T cell responses. 
Multivariate modeling of influenza-specific responses pre-vaccination with 
influenza-specific antibody titers and IFN-γ ELISpot as outcome measures 
identified several T cell and APC subsets that negatively or positively 
predicted protective responses to the vaccine. However, none of the functional 
differences between AD and Non-AD had high predictive value on adaptive 
responses to influenza vaccine, which was in agreement with the overall similar 
responses to the vaccine in the parent clinical trial.

BACKGROUND: Only some patients with peanut allergy undergoing oral immunotherapy 
(OIT) achieve sustained clinical response. Basophil activation could provide a 
functional surrogate of efficacy.
OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that changes in basophil sensitivity and area under 
the curve (AUC) to the immunodominant allergen Ara h 2 correlate with clinical 
responses to OIT.
METHODS: Children with peanut allergy aged 7 to 13 years were enrolled in a 
single-center, open-label peanut OIT trial. Levels of specific immunoglobulins 
were measured throughout OIT. Peripheral blood from multiple time points was 
stimulated in vitro with peanut allergens for flow cytometric assessment of the 
percentage of CD63hi activated basophils.
RESULTS: Twenty-two of 30 subjects were successfully treated with OIT; after 
avoidance, 9 achieved sustained unresponsiveness (SU), and 13 had transient 
desensitization (TD). Basophil sensitivity, measured by using the dose that 
induces 50% of the maximal basophil response, to Ara h 2 stimulation decreased 
from baseline in subjects with SU (after OIT, P = .0041; after avoidance, 
P = .0011). At 3 months of OIT, basophil sensitivity in subjects with SU 
decreased from baseline compared with that in subjects with TD (median, 18-fold 
vs 3-fold; P = .01), with a receiver operating characteristic of 0.84 and 
optimal fold change of 4.9. Basophil AUC to Ara h 2 was suppressed after OIT 
equally in subjects with SU and those with TD (P = .4). After avoidance, 
basophil AUC rebounded in subjects with TD but not those with SU (P < .001). 
Passively sensitized basophils suppressed with postavoidance SU plasma had a 
lower AUC than TD plasma (6.4% vs 38.9%, P = .03).
CONCLUSIONS: Early decreases in basophil sensitivity to Ara h 2 correlate with 
SU. Basophil AUC rebounds after avoidance in subjects with TD. Therefore, 
different aspects of basophil activation might be useful for monitoring of OIT 
efficacy.

BACKGROUND: Cockroach is one of the most important sources of indoor allergens 
and can lead to IgE sensitization and development of rhinitis and asthma.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to perform a cockroach allergen component analysis to 
determine the allergens and antibody levels and patterns of sensitization 
associated with asthma and rhinitis.
METHODS: Antibody (IgE, IgG, and IgG4) levels to total cockroach and 8 cockroach 
allergens were determined in 2 groups of cockroach-sensitized 10-year-old 
children with (n = 19) or without (n = 28) asthma and rhinitis. 
Allergen-specific antibody levels were measured in streptavidin ImmunoCAPs 
loaded with each of the recombinant allergens from groups 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 
and 11, and total cockroach-specific IgE levels were measured with the i6 
ImmunoCAP.
RESULTS: IgE antibody levels to cockroach allergens and extract, but not IgG or 
IgG4 antibody levels, differed between subjects with and without asthma and 
rhinitis. Specifically, recognition of more cockroach allergens with higher 
allergen-specific IgE levels was associated with disease. Variable patterns of 
sensitization with no immunodominant allergens were found in both groups. There 
was a good correlation between the sum of allergen-specific IgE and total 
cockroach IgE levels (r = 0.86, P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Component analysis of 8 cockroach allergens revealed significant 
differences in IgE reactivity associated with the presence of asthma and 
rhinitis. Allergen-specific IgE titers and sensitization profiles were 
associated with asthma and rhinitis.

BACKGROUND: In infants, distinct nasopharyngeal bacterial microbiotas 
differentially associate with the incidence and severity of acute respiratory 
tract infection and childhood asthma development.
OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that distinct nasal airway microbiota structures also 
exist in children with asthma and relate to clinical outcomes.
METHODS: Nasal secretion samples (n = 3122) collected after randomization during 
the fall season from children with asthma (6-17 years, n = 413) enrolled in a 
trial of omalizumab (anti-IgE) underwent 16S rRNA profiling. Statistical 
analyses with exacerbation as the primary outcome and rhinovirus infection and 
respiratory illnesses as secondary outcomes were performed. Using A549 
epithelial cells, we assessed nasal isolates of Moraxella, Staphylococcus, and 
Corynebacterium species for their capacity to induce epithelial damage and 
inflammatory responses.
RESULTS: Six nasal airway microbiota assemblages, each dominated by Moraxella, 
Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, Streptococcus, Alloiococcus, or Haemophilus 
species, were observed. Moraxella and Staphylococcus species-dominated 
microbiotas were most frequently detected and exhibited temporal stability. 
Nasal microbiotas dominated by Moraxella species were associated with increased 
exacerbation risk and eosinophil activation. Staphylococcus or Corynebacterium 
species-dominated microbiotas were associated with reduced respiratory illness 
and exacerbation events, whereas Streptococcus species-dominated assemblages 
increased the risk of rhinovirus infection. Nasal microbiota composition 
remained relatively stable despite viral infection or exacerbation; only a few 
taxa belonging to the dominant genera exhibited relative abundance fluctuations 
during these events. In vitro, Moraxella catarrhalis induced significantly 
greater epithelial damage and inflammatory cytokine expression (IL-33 and IL-8) 
compared with other dominant nasal bacterial isolates tested.
CONCLUSION: Distinct nasal airway microbiotas of children with asthma relate to 
the likelihood of exacerbation, rhinovirus infection, and respiratory illnesses 
during the fall season.

BACKGROUND: Allergy to German cockroach (CR) is common in urban environments and 
is an important allergen in children with asthma.
OBJECTIVE: We hypothesize that the evolution of allergic sensitization and 
clinical disease is associated with distinct patterns of allergen-specific T 
cell reactivity. To test this hypothesis, a subset of high-risk inner-city 
children participating in the URECA (Urban Environment and Childhood Asthma) 
birth cohort were selected to evaluate CR-specific T cell reactivity from three 
distinct groups based on acquisition of aeroallergen sensitivity from ages 2 to 
10: low atopy with minimal to no sensitivity (n = 26), early-onset allergic 
sensitization (n = 25) and late-onset allergic sensitization (n = 25).
METHODS: Using pools of previously identified CR-derived T cell epitopes, we 
characterized the allergen-specific T cell response in these 76 subjects from 
blood samples obtained at age 10. CR-specific production of IL-5, IFNγ and IL-10 
was measured by ELISPOT following two-week in vitro culture with CR extract.
RESULTS: T cell responses were significantly higher in the early-onset atopy 
group compared to low atopy (P = 0.01), and a trend for higher cytokine 
production in the late onset compared to the low atopy cohort was also observed 
(P = 0.06). T cell responses were similar between early- and late-onset cohorts. 
Furthermore, a comparison of T cell reactivity between asthmatic and 
non-asthmatic individuals revealed significantly higher cytokine production in 
asthmatics compared to non-asthmatics (P = 0.02) within both the CR-allergic and 
non-allergic cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In conclusion, the present study reports 
that higher T cell reactivity is associated with allergen sensitization and 
asthma. Interestingly, no significant difference in T cell reactivity was 
observed in allergic children with early-onset versus late-onset atopy.

Skin barrier dysfunction has been reported in both atopic dermatitis (AD) and 
food allergy (FA). However, only one-third of patients with AD have FA. The 
purpose of this study was to use a minimally invasive skin tape strip sampling 
method and a multiomics approach to determine whether children with AD and FA 
(AD FA+) have stratum corneum (SC) abnormalities that distinguish them from AD 
without FA (AD FA-) and nonatopic (NA) controls. Transepidermal water loss was 
found to be increased in AD FA+. Filaggrin and the proportion of ω-hydroxy fatty 
acid sphingosine ceramide content in nonlesional skin of children with AD FA+ 
were substantially lower than in AD FA- and NA skin. These abnormalities 
correlated with morphologic changes in epidermal lamellar bilayer architecture 
responsible for barrier homeostasis. Shotgun metagenomic studies revealed that 
the nonlesional skin of AD FA+ had increased abundance of Staphylococcus aureus 
compared to NA. Increased expression of keratins 5, 14, and 16 indicative of 
hyperproliferative keratinocytes was observed in the SC of AD FA+. The skin 
transcriptome of AD FA+ had increased gene expression for dendritic cells and 
type 2 immune pathways. A network analysis revealed keratins 5, 14, and 16 were 
positively correlated with AD FA+, whereas filaggrin breakdown products were 
negatively correlated with AD FA+. These data suggest that the most superficial 
compartment of nonlesional skin in AD FA+ has unique properties associated with 
an immature skin barrier and type 2 immune activation.

BACKGROUND: Multicenter randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for asthma 
management that incorporate usual-care regimens could benefit from standardized 
application of evidence-based guidelines.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate performance of a computerized decision support 
tool, the Asthma Control Evaluation and Treatment (ACET) Program, to standardize 
usual-care regimens for asthma management in RCTs.
METHODS: Children and adolescents with persistent uncontrolled asthma living in 
urban census tracts were recruited into 3 multicenter RCTs (each with a 
usual-care arm) between 2004 and 2014. A computerized decision support tool 
scored asthma control and assigned an appropriate treatment step based on 
published guidelines. Control-level determinants (symptoms, rescue medication 
use, pulmonary function measure, and adherence estimates) were collected at 
visits and entered into the ACET Program. Changes in control levels and 
treatment steps were examined during the trials.
RESULTS: At screening, more than half of the participants were rated as having 
symptoms that were not controlled or poorly controlled. The proportion of 
participants who gained good control between screening and randomization 
increased significantly in all 3 trials. Between 51% and 70% had symptoms that 
were well controlled by randomization. The proportion of well-controlled 
participants remained constant or improved slightly from randomization until the 
last posttreatment visit. Nighttime symptoms were the most common control-level 
determinant; there were few (<1%) instances of complete overlap of factors. FEV1 
was the driver of control-level assignment in 30% of determinations.
CONCLUSION: The ACET Program decision support tool facilitated standardized 
asthma assessment and treatment in multicenter RCTs and was associated with 
attaining and maintaining good asthma control in most participants.

RATIONALE: Characterization of patterns of wheezing and allergic sensitization 
in early life may allow for identification of specific environmental exposures 
impacting asthma development.
OBJECTIVES: To define respiratory phenotypes in inner-city children and their 
associations with early-life environmental exposures.
METHODS: Data were collected prospectively from 442 children in the URECA (Urban 
Environment and Childhood Asthma) birth cohort through age 7 years, reflecting 
symptoms (wheezing), aeroallergen sensitization, pulmonary function, and body 
mass index. Latent class mixed models identified trajectories of wheezing, 
allergic sensitization, and pulmonary function. Cluster analysis defined 
nonoverlapping groups (termed phenotypes). Potential associations between 
phenotypes and early-life environmental exposures were examined.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Five phenotypes were identified and mainly 
differentiated by patterns of wheezing and allergic sensitization (low 
wheeze/low atopy; low wheeze/high atopy; transient wheeze/low atopy; high 
wheeze/low atopy; high wheeze/high atopy). Asthma was most often present in the 
high-wheeze phenotypes, with greatest respiratory morbidity among children with 
frequent wheezing and allergic sensitization. These phenotypes differentially 
related to early-life exposures, including maternal stress and depression, 
antenatal environmental tobacco smoke, house dust microbiome, and allergen 
content (all P < 0.05). Prenatal smoke exposure, maternal stress, and depression 
were highest in the high-wheeze/low-atopy phenotype. The high-wheeze/high-atopy 
phenotype was associated with low household microbial richness and diversity. 
Early-life aeroallergen exposure was low in high-wheeze phenotypes.
CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of wheezing, allergic sensitization, and lung function 
identified five respiratory phenotypes among inner-city children. Early-life 
environmental exposure to stress, depression, tobacco smoke, and indoor 
allergens and microbes differentially associate with specific phenotypes.

BACKGROUND: Children with asthma are at increased risk for experiencing health 
and educational disparities because of increased school absence. School nurses 
are well positioned to support asthma management and improve school attendance.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to implement and assess the effect of the Building Bridges 
for Asthma Care Program on improving school attendance and measures of asthma 
control.
METHODS: Children with asthma (age, 5-14 years) in the Denver Public School 
System (n = 240) and the Hartford Public School System (n = 223) were enrolled 
in the Building Bridges Program during the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 school years 
and followed until the end of the second school year. The primary outcome was 
school absence, with secondary outcomes, including asthma control, measured 
based on Childhood Asthma Control Test or the Asthma Control Test scores and 
rescue inhaler use.
RESULTS: Participants experienced a 22% absolute decrease in school absenteeism, 
the number of children with an Asthma Control Test/Childhood Asthma Control Test 
score of less than the control threshold of 20 decreased from 42.7% to 28.8%, 
and bronchodilator use greater than 2 times per week decreased from 35.8% to 
22.9% (all changes were significant, P < .01).
CONCLUSIONS: Children enrolled in the Building Bridges for Asthma Care Program 
experienced reduced school absence and improved asthma control.

BACKGROUND: Bedroom allergen exposures contribute to allergic disease morbidity 
because people spend considerable time in bedrooms, where they come into close 
contact with allergen reservoirs.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated participant and housing characteristics, including 
sociodemographic, regional, and climatic factors, associated with bedroom 
allergen exposures in a nationally representative sample of the US population.
METHODS: Data were obtained from National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey 2005-2006. Information on participant and housing characteristics was 
collected by using questionnaires and environmental assessments. Concentrations 
of 8 indoor allergens (Alt a 1, Bla g 1, Can f 1, Fel d 1, Der f 1, Der p 1, Mus 
m 1, and Rat n 1) in dust vacuumed from nearly 7000 bedrooms were measured by 
using immunoassays. Exposure levels were classified as increased based on 
percentile (75th/90th) cutoffs. We estimated the burden of exposure to multiple 
allergens and used multivariable logistic regression to identify independent 
predictors for each allergen and household allergen burden.
RESULTS: Almost all participants (>99%) had at least 1 and 74.2% had 3 to 6 
allergens detected. More than two thirds of participants (72.9%) had at least 1 
allergen and 18.2% had 3 or more allergens exceeding increased levels. Although 
exposure variability showed significant racial/ethnic and regional differences, 
high exposure burden to multiple allergens was most consistently associated with 
the presence of pets and pests, living in mobile homes/trailers and older and 
rental homes, and living in nonmetropolitan areas.
CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to multiple allergens is common. Despite highly variable 
exposures, bedroom allergen burden is strongly associated with the presence of 
pets and pests.

BACKGROUND: Environmental exposures in early life appear to play an important 
role in the pathogenesis of childhood asthma, but the potentially modifiable 
exposures that lead to asthma remain uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify early-life environmental risk factors for 
childhood asthma in a birth cohort of high-risk inner-city children.
METHODS: We examined the relationship of prenatal and early-life environmental 
factors to the occurrence of asthma at 7 years of age among 442 children.
RESULTS: Higher house dust concentrations of cockroach, mouse, and cat allergens 
in the first 3 years of life were associated with lower risk of asthma (for 
cockroach allergen: odds ratio per interquartile range increase in 
concentration, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.36-0.86; P < .01). House dust microbiome analysis 
using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing identified 202 and 171 bacterial taxa that 
were significantly (false discovery rate < 0.05) more or less abundant, 
respectively, in the homes of children with asthma. A majority of these bacteria 
were significantly correlated with 1 of more allergen concentrations. Other 
factors associated significantly positively with asthma included umbilical cord 
plasma cotinine concentration (odds ratio per geometric SD increase in 
concentration, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.00-3.09; P = .048) and maternal stress and 
depression scores.
CONCLUSION: Among high-risk inner-city children, higher indoor levels of pet or 
pest allergens in infancy were associated with lower risk of asthma. The 
abundance of a number of bacterial taxa in house dust was associated with 
increased or decreased asthma risk. Prenatal tobacco smoke exposure and higher 
maternal stress and depression scores in early life were associated with 
increased asthma risk.

BACKGROUND: Atopy and viral respiratory tract infections synergistically promote 
asthma exacerbations. IgE cross-linking inhibits critical virus-induced IFN-α 
responses of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), which can be deficient in 
patients with allergic asthma.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether reducing IgE levels in vivo with 
omalizumab treatment increases pDC antiviral IFN-α responses in inner-city 
children with asthma.
METHODS: PBMCs and pDCs isolated from children with exacerbation-prone asthma 
before and during omalizumab treatment were stimulated ex vivo with rhinovirus 
and influenza in the presence or absence of IgE cross-linking. IFN-α levels were 
measured in supernatants, and mRNA expression of IFN-α pathway genes was 
determined by using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) in cell pellets. FcεRIα 
protein levels and mRNA expression were measured in unstimulated cells by using 
flow cytometry and qRT-PCR, respectively. Changes in these outcomes and 
associations with clinical outcomes were analyzed, and statistical modeling was 
used to identify risk factors for asthma exacerbations.
RESULTS: Omalizumab treatment increased rhinovirus- and influenza-induced PBMC 
and rhinovirus-induced pDC IFN-α responses in the presence of IgE cross-linking 
and reduced pDC surface FcεRIα expression. Omalizumab-induced reductions in pDC 
FcεRIα levels were significantly associated with a lower asthma exacerbation 
rate during the outcome period and correlated with increases in PBMC IFN-α 
responses. PBMC FcεRIα mRNA expression measured on study entry significantly 
improved an existing model of exacerbation prediction.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that omalizumab treatment augments pDC 
IFN-α responses and attenuates pDC FcεRIα protein expression and provide 
evidence that these effects are related. These results support a potential 
mechanism underlying clinical observations that allergic sensitization is 
associated with increased susceptibility to virus-induced asthma exacerbations.

BACKGROUND: Although pets are found in more than 50% of US homes, the effect of 
pet allergen exposure on asthma morbidity in the US population is not well 
documented.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of dog and cat allergen exposures on asthma 
morbidity in the US population.
METHODS: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey is a 
representative sample of civilian US population. Data on asthma, dog and cat 
allergen levels in bedroom dust, as well as specific IgE to dog and cat were 
analyzed for all participants 6 years or older.
RESULTS: Pets are common in the United States, with more that 50% of households 
having a dog or a cat or both. The prevalence of allergic sensitization in the 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey population was similar for dog 
and cat, with both being approximately 12%. Among those who were sensitized, 
exposure to elevated levels of pet allergens was associated with an increased 
prevalence of asthma and asthma attacks. Indeed, 44.2% of the asthma attacks 
were attributable to exposure to high levels of dog allergen in the bedroom 
among patients with asthma sensitive to dog and 30.3% were attributable to cat 
allergen exposure among the comparable cat-sensitive and exposed group. 
Projecting these results to the US population indicates more than 1 million 
increased asthma attacks each year for the dog-sensitive and exposed group and 
more than 500,000 increased asthma attacks for the cat-sensitive and exposed 
population of patients with asthma.
CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to elevated levels of dog and cat allergens among those 
sensitized individuals with asthma is associated with excess asthma attacks. 
Reducing pet allergen exposures has the potential for a significant decrease in 
asthma morbidity.

BACKGROUND: Conventional data analysis of flow cytometry-based basophil 
activation testing requires repetitive, labor-intensive analysis that hampers 
efforts to standardize testing for clinical applications. Using an open-source 
platform, we developed and implemented a programmatic approach to the analysis 
of the basophil activation test (BAT) by flow cytometry.
METHODS: Using the BÜHLMANN FlowCAST® assay, peripheral blood from peanut 
allergic patients undergoing oral immunotherapy was incubated with peanut 
allergens (Arah1, Arah2, Arah6, whole peanut extract) and stained with 
fluorescent antibodies to CCR3 and CD63 for the development of a data-driven 
programmatic analysis using Bioconductor and R. Basophil identification using 
clustering and classification was validated using manually gated comparisons in 
an experimental subset. Reproducibility of CD63 upregulation set on unstimulated 
or anti-FcERI stimulated basophils was compared.
RESULTS: BAT analysis of 294 experiments was successful in 91.5% using the above 
approach, with a total of 7,166 individual basophil activation tests from 269 
experiments. We estimate this represents a net saving of 1340 min of labor by a 
skilled operator. Medium-based gating correlated to respective manual gating 
more closely than anti-FcERI based gating (R = 0.96 vs. R = 0.84, P < 0.001). 
Only 2% of the basophil activation results were significantly different from 
manual gating. Quality measures of the experiments and other measures of 
basophil activation were also provided by the analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: We present a novel data-driven flow cytometric platform for the 
analysis of clinical basophil activation testing, providing a high throughput 
objective approach to basophil activation analysis. © 2017 International

RATIONALE: Allergic inflammation has been linked to increased susceptibility to 
viral illnesses, but it is unclear whether this association is causal.
OBJECTIVES: To test whether omalizumab treatment to reduce IgE would shorten the 
frequency and duration of rhinovirus (RV) illnesses in children with allergic 
asthma.
METHODS: In the PROSE (Preventative Omalizumab or Step-up Therapy for Severe 
Fall Exacerbations) study, we examined children with allergic asthma (aged 6-17 
yr; n = 478) from low-income census tracts in eight U.S. cities, and we analyzed 
virology for the groups randomized to treatment with guidelines-based asthma 
care (n = 89) or add-on omalizumab (n = 259). Weekly nasal mucus samples were 
analyzed for RVs, and respiratory symptoms and asthma exacerbations were 
recorded over a 90-day period during the fall seasons of 2012 or 2013. Adjusted 
illness rates (illnesses per sample) by treatment arm were calculated using 
Poisson regression.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: RVs were detected in 97 (57%) of 171 exacerbation 
samples and 2,150 (36%) of 5,959 nonexacerbation samples (OR, 2.32; P < 0.001). 
Exacerbations were significantly associated with detection of rhinovirus C (OR, 
2.85; P < 0.001) and rhinovirus A (OR, 2.92; P < 0.001), as well as, to a lesser 
extent, rhinovirus B (OR, 1.98; P = 0.019). Omalizumab decreased the duration of 
RV infection (11.2 d vs. 12.4 d; P = 0.03) and reduced peak RV shedding by 0.4 
log units (95% confidence interval, -0.77 to -0.02; P = 0.04). Finally, 
omalizumab decreased the frequency of RV illnesses (risk ratio, 0.64; 95% 
confidence interval, 0.49-0.84).
CONCLUSIONS: In children with allergic asthma, treatment with omalizumab 
decreased the duration of RV infections, viral shedding, and the risk of RV 
illnesses. These findings provide direct evidence that blocking IgE decreases 
susceptibility to RV infections and illness. Clinical trial registered with 
www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01430403).

BACKGROUND: A Seasonal Asthma Exacerbation Predictive Index (saEPI) was 
previously reported based on 2 prior National Institute of Allergy and 
Infectious Diseases Inner City Asthma Consortium trials.
OBJECTIVE: This study sought to validate the saEPI in a separate trial designed 
to prevent fall exacerbations with omalizumab therapy.
METHODS: The saEPI and its components were analyzed to characterize those who 
had an asthma exacerbation during the Preventative Omalizumab or Step-Up Therapy 
for Fall Exacerbations (PROSE) study. We characterized those inner-city children 
with and without asthma exacerbations in the fall period treated with 
guidelines-based therapy (GBT) in the absence and presence of omalizumab.
RESULTS: A higher saEPI was associated with an exacerbation in both the GBT 
alone (P < .001; area under the curve, 0.76) and the GBT + omalizumab group 
(P < .01; area under the curve, 0.65). In the GBT group, younger age at 
recruitment, higher total IgE, higher blood eosinophil percentage and number, 
and higher treatment step were associated with those who had an exacerbation 
compared with those who did not. In the GBT + omalizumab group, younger age at 
recruitment, increased eosinophil number, recent exacerbation, and higher 
treatment step were also associated with those who had an exacerbation. The 
saEPI was associated with a high negative predictive value in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: An exacerbation in children treated with GBT with or without 
omalizumab was associated with a higher saEPI along with higher markers of 
allergic inflammation, treatment step, and a recent exacerbation. Those that 
exacerbated on omalizumab had similar features with the exception of some 
markers of allergic sensitization, indicating a need to develop better markers 
to predict poor response to omalizumab therapy and alternative treatment 
strategies for children with these risk factors. The saEPI was able to reliably 
predict those children unlikely to have an asthma exacerbation in both groups.

BACKGROUND: Disadvantaged urban children have high rates of allergic diseases 
and wheezing, which are diseases associated with type 2-biased immunity.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether environmental exposures in early life 
influence cytokine responses that affect the development of recurrent wheezing 
illnesses and allergic sensitization.
METHODS: A birth cohort of 560 urban families was recruited from neighborhoods 
with high rates of poverty, and 467 (83%) children were followed until 3 years 
of age. Cytokine responses were measured in blood cell samples obtained at birth 
(cord blood) and ages 1 and 3 years. Cytokine responses were examined in 
relation to personal characteristics and environmental exposures to allergens 
and endotoxin and to the development of allergic sensitization and recurrent 
wheeze assessed at age 3 years.
RESULTS: Cytokine responses generally increased with age, but responses at birth 
were poorly predictive for those at ages 1 and 3 years. Exposure to certain 
allergens (cockroach, mouse, dust mite) was significantly associated with 
enhanced cytokine responses at age 3 years, including IFN-α and IL-10 responses 
to certain stimulants and responses to phytohemagglutinin. Regarding the 
clinical outcomes, reduced LPS-induced IL-10 responses at birth were associated 
with recurrent wheeze. In contrast, reduced respiratory syncytial virus-induced 
IL-8 responses and increased 5'-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3' (CpG)-induced 
IL-12p40 and allergen-induced IL-4 responses were associated with atopy.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that diverse biologic exposures, including 
allergens and endotoxin, in urban homes stimulate the development of cytokine 
responses in early life, and that cytokine responses to specific microbial and 
viral stimuli are associated with the development of allergic sensitization and 
recurrent wheeze.

BACKGROUND: Aged asthmatic patients experience increased morbidity and 
mortality. Knowledge of the aging effect on airway inflammation and asthma 
control is limited.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare airway inflammation and its relationship to 
asthma control in aged versus younger patients and determine whether differences 
are asthma specific or caused by "inflamm-aging."
METHODS: We performed a prospective study of aged (>60 years) and younger 
(21-40 years) inner-city patients with asthma. After a run-in period to control 
for inhaled corticosteroid use, induced sputum was collected. Age-matched 
nonasthmatic control subjects were included to measure age-related inflammatory 
changes.
RESULTS: Aged (mean age, 67.9 ± 5.1 years; n = 35) compared with younger (mean 
age, 30.8 ± 5.9 years; n = 37) asthmatic patients had significantly worse asthma 
control and lower FEV1. Aged asthmatic patients had higher sputum neutrophil 
(30.5 × 104/mL and 23.1%) and eosinophil (7.0 × 104/mL and 3.8%) numbers and 
percentages compared with younger patients (neutrophils, 13.0 × 104/mL [P < .01] 
and 6.9% [P < .01]; eosinophils, 2.0 × 104/mL [P < .01] and 1.2% [P < .01]). 
Aged asthmatic patients had higher sputum IL-6 (P < .01) and IL-8 (P = .01) 
levels. No significant inflammatory differences between aged and younger control 
subjects were observed. In aged asthmatic patients increased sputum IL-6 and 
macrophage inflammatory protein 3α/CCL20 levels were significantly associated 
with decreased asthma control and increased sputum neutrophil numbers and IL-1β, 
IL-6, and macrophage inflammatory protein 3α/CCL20 levels were associated with 
hospitalization.
CONCLUSIONS: The inflammatory patterns of aged versus younger asthmatic patients 
are associated with increased sputum neutrophil and eosinophil values and 
cytokine levels related to neutrophil recruitment. Differences in airway 
inflammation can contribute to diminished asthma control in the aged. Further 
understanding of asthma pathophysiology in aged patients is needed to improve 
management of this vulnerable population.

BACKGROUND: Environmental exposures to indoor allergens are major contributors 
to asthma symptoms, particularly in inner cities. The effectiveness of household 
allergen reduction as an adjunct to National Asthma Education Prevention Program 
guideline-based pharmacologic therapy in asthma has not been prospectively 
studied.
OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of individualized allergen reduction on ability 
to reduce asthma pharmacologic therapy over 40 weeks.
METHODS: We performed a randomized controlled trial to determine the effect of 
multifaceted indoor allergen avoidance measures on the ability to reduce asthma 
controller therapy in adults and children residing in New York City who were 
both sensitized and exposed to at least 1 indoor allergen. Asthma treatment and 
control were optimized in all subjects before randomization.
RESULTS: A total of 125 subjects were randomized to receive individualized 
household allergen reduction and 122 received a sham intervention. Subjects in 
the intervention group significantly reduced all measured allergen levels (cat, 
dog, dust mite allergens in the bedroom, cockroach and mouse allergens in the 
kitchen and bedroom); those in the control group reduced only dust mite and 
mouse allergens in the bedroom and cockroach allergen in the kitchen. 
Participants in the intervention arm reduced National Asthma Education 
Prevention Program-based therapy from step 4.4 at randomization to 3.50 
postintervention (range, 0-6); participants in the control arm reduced 
medication from step 4.4 to 3.4 (P = .76). There were no differences in other 
measured asthma outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Targeted allergen avoidance measures do not allow for reduction in 
asthma pharmacologic therapy compared with usual care in patients already 
receiving optimal controller therapy.

BACKGROUND: Short-term targeted treatment can potentially prevent fall asthma 
exacerbations while limiting therapy exposure.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare (1) omalizumab with placebo and (2) omalizumab 
with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) boost with regard to fall exacerbation 
rates when initiated 4 to 6 weeks before return to school.
METHODS: A 3-arm, randomized, double-blind, double placebo-controlled, 
multicenter clinical trial was conducted among inner-city asthmatic children 
aged 6 to 17 years with 1 or more recent exacerbations (clincaltrials.gov 
#NCT01430403). Guidelines-based therapy was continued over a 4- to 9-month 
run-in phase and a 4-month intervention phase. In a subset the effects of 
omalizumab on IFN-α responses to rhinovirus in PBMCs were examined.
RESULTS: Before the falls of 2012 and 2013, 727 children were enrolled, 513 were 
randomized, and 478 were analyzed. The fall exacerbation rate was significantly 
lower in the omalizumab versus placebo arms (11.3% vs 21.0%; odds ratio [OR], 
0.48; 95% CI, 0.25-0.92), but there was no significant difference between 
omalizumab and ICS boost (8.4% vs 11.1%; OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.33-1.64). In a 
prespecified subgroup analysis, among participants with an exacerbation during 
the run-in phase, omalizumab was significantly more efficacious than both 
placebo (6.4% vs 36.3%; OR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.02-0.64) and ICS boost (2.0% vs 
27.8%; OR, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.002-0.98). Omalizumab improved IFN-α responses to 
rhinovirus, and within the omalizumab group, greater IFN-α increases were 
associated with fewer exacerbations (OR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.01-0.88). Adverse 
events were rare and similar among arms.
CONCLUSIONS: Adding omalizumab before return to school to ongoing 
guidelines-based care among inner-city youth reduces fall asthma exacerbations, 
particularly among those with a recent exacerbation.

BACKGROUND: Peanut oral immunotherapy (PNOIT) induces persistent tolerance to 
peanut in a subset of patients and induces specific antibodies that might play a 
role in clinical protection. However, the contribution of induced antibody 
clones to clinical tolerance in PNOIT is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that PNOIT induces a clonal, allergen-specific B-cell 
response that could serve as a surrogate for clinical outcomes.
METHODS: We used a fluorescent Ara h 2 multimer for affinity selection of Ara h 
2-specific B cells and subsequent single-cell immunoglobulin amplification. The 
diversity of related clones was evaluated by means of next-generation sequencing 
of immunoglobulin heavy chains from circulating memory B cells with 2x250 
paired-end sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform.
RESULTS: Expression of class-switched antibodies from Ara h 2-positive cells 
confirms enrichment for Ara h 2 specificity. PNOIT induces an early and 
transient expansion of circulating Ara h 2-specific memory B cells that peaks at 
week 7. Ara h 2-specific sequences from memory cells have rates of nonsilent 
mutations consistent with affinity maturation. The repertoire of Ara h 
2-specific antibodies is oligoclonal. Next-generation sequencing-based 
repertoire analysis of circulating memory B cells reveals evidence for 
convergent selection of related sequences in 3 unrelated subjects, suggesting 
the presence of similar Ara h 2-specific B-cell clones.
CONCLUSIONS: Using a novel affinity selection approach to identify 
antigen-specific B cells, we demonstrate that the early PNOIT-induced Ara h 
2-specific B-cell receptor repertoire is oligoclonal and somatically 
hypermutated and shares similar clonal groups among unrelated subjects 
consistent with convergent selection.

BACKGROUND: Asthma exacerbations remain common, even in children and 
adolescents, despite optimal medical management. Identification of host risk 
factors for exacerbations is incomplete, particularly for seasonal episodes.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to define host risk factors for asthma exacerbations unique 
to their season of occurrence.
METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of patients aged 6 to 20 years who 
comprised the control groups of the Asthma Control Evaluation study and the 
Inner City Anti-IgE Therapy for Asthma study. Univariate and multivariate models 
were constructed to determine whether patients' demographic and historical 
factors, allergic sensitization, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide values, 
spirometric measurements, asthma control, and treatment requirements were 
associated with seasonal exacerbations.
RESULTS: The analysis included 400 patients (54.5% male; 59.0% African American; 
median age, 13 years). Exacerbations occurred in 37.5% of participants over the 
periods of observation and were most common in the fall (28.8% of participants). 
In univariate analysis impaired pulmonary function was significantly associated 
with greater odds of exacerbations for all seasons, as was an exacerbation in 
the previous season for all seasons except spring. In multivariate analysis 
exacerbation in the previous season was the strongest predictor in fall and 
winter, whereas a higher requirement for inhaled corticosteroids was the 
strongest predictor in spring and summer. The multivariate models had the best 
predictive power for fall exacerbations (30.5% variance attributed).
CONCLUSIONS: Among a large cohort of inner-city children with asthma, patients' 
risk factors for exacerbation vary by season. Thus information on individual 
patients might be beneficial in strategies to prevent these seasonal events.

BACKGROUND: Epigenetic marks are heritable, influenced by the environment, 
direct the maturation of T lymphocytes, and in mice enhance the development of 
allergic airway disease. Thus it is important to define epigenetic alterations 
in asthmatic populations.
OBJECTIVE: We hypothesize that epigenetic alterations in circulating PBMCs are 
associated with allergic asthma.
METHODS: We compared DNA methylation patterns and gene expression in inner-city 
children with persistent atopic asthma versus healthy control subjects by using 
DNA and RNA from PBMCs. Results were validated in an independent population of 
asthmatic patients.
RESULTS: Comparing asthmatic patients (n = 97) with control subjects (n = 97), 
we identified 81 regions that were differentially methylated. Several immune 
genes were hypomethylated in asthma, including IL13, RUNX3, and specific genes 
relevant to T lymphocytes (TIGIT). Among asthmatic patients, 11 differentially 
methylated regions were associated with higher serum IgE concentrations, and 16 
were associated with percent predicted FEV1. Hypomethylated and hypermethylated 
regions were associated with increased and decreased gene expression, 
respectively (P < 6 × 10(-12) for asthma and P < .01 for IgE). We further 
explored the relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression using an 
integrative analysis and identified additional candidates relevant to asthma 
(IL4 and ST2). Methylation marks involved in T-cell maturation (RUNX3), TH2 
immunity (IL4), and oxidative stress (catalase) were validated in an independent 
asthmatic cohort of children living in the inner city.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that DNA methylation marks in specific gene 
loci are associated with asthma and suggest that epigenetic changes might play a 
role in establishing the immune phenotype associated with asthma.

BACKGROUND: Wheezing illnesses cause major morbidity in infants and are frequent 
precursors to asthma.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine environmental factors associated with recurrent 
wheezing in inner-city environments.
METHODS: The Urban Environment and Childhood Asthma study examined a birth 
cohort at high risk for asthma (n = 560) in Baltimore, Boston, New York, and St 
Louis. Environmental assessments included allergen exposure and, in a nested 
case-control study of 104 children, the bacterial content of house dust 
collected in the first year of life. Associations were determined among 
environmental factors, aeroallergen sensitization, and recurrent wheezing at age 
3 years.
RESULTS: Cumulative allergen exposure over the first 3 years was associated with 
allergic sensitization, and sensitization at age 3 years was related to 
recurrent wheeze. In contrast, first-year exposure to cockroach, mouse, and cat 
allergens was negatively associated with recurrent wheeze (odds ratio, 0.60, 
0.65, and 0.75, respectively; P ≤ .01). Differences in house dust bacterial 
content in the first year, especially reduced exposure to specific Firmicutes 
and Bacteriodetes, was associated with atopy and atopic wheeze. Exposure to high 
levels of both allergens and this subset of bacteria in the first year of life 
was most common among children without atopy or wheeze.
CONCLUSIONS: In inner-city environments children with the highest exposure to 
specific allergens and bacteria during their first year were least likely to 
have recurrent wheeze and allergic sensitization. These findings suggest that 
concomitant exposure to high levels of certain allergens and bacteria in early 
life might be beneficial and suggest new preventive strategies for wheezing and 
allergic diseases.

BACKGROUND: Treatment regimens for omalizumab are guided by a dosing table that 
is based on total serum IgE and body weight. Limited data exist about onset and 
offset of omalizumab efficacy in children and adolescents or subgroups that most 
benefit from treatment.
OBJECTIVES: Post hoc analyses were conducted to (1) examine patient 
characteristics of those eligible and ineligible for omalizumab, (2) describe 
onset of effect after initiation of omalizumab and offset of treatment effect 
after stopping therapy, and (3) determine whether the efficacy differs by age, 
asthma severity, dosing regimen, and prespecified biomarkers.
METHODS: Inner-city children and adolescents with persistent allergic asthma 
were enrolled in the Inner-City Anti-IgE Therapy for Asthma trial that compared 
omalizumab with placebo added to guidelines-based therapy for 60 weeks.
RESULTS: Two hundred ninety-three of 889 participants (33%) clinically suitable 
for omalizumab were ineligible for dosing according to a modified dosing table 
specifying IgE level and body weight criteria. Baseline symptoms were comparable 
among those eligible and ineligible to receive omalizumab, but other 
characteristics (rate of health care utilization and skin test results) 
differed. The time of onset of omalizumab effect was <30 days and time of offset 
was between 30 and 120 days. No difference in efficacy was noted by age or 
asthma severity, but high exhaled nitric oxide, blood eosinophils, and body mass 
index predicted efficacy.
CONCLUSIONS: A significant portion of children and adolescents particularly 
suited for omalizumab because of asthma severity status may be ineligible due to 
IgE >1300 IU/mL. Omalizumab reduced asthma symptoms and exacerbations rapidly; 
features associated with efficacy can be identified to guide patient selection.

BACKGROUND: Allergic sensitization is an important risk factor for the 
development of atopic disease. The National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey (NHANES) 2005-2006 provides the most comprehensive information on 
IgE-mediated sensitization in the general US population.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated clustering, sociodemographic, and regional patterns 
of allergic sensitization and examined risk factors associated with IgE-mediated 
sensitization.
METHODS: Data for this cross-sectional analysis were obtained from NHANES 
2005-2006. Participants aged 1 year or older (n = 9440) were tested for serum 
specific IgEs (sIgEs) to inhalant and food allergens; participants 6 years or 
older were tested for 19 sIgEs, and children aged 1 to 5 years were tested for 9 
sIgEs. Serum samples were analyzed by using the ImmunoCAP System. Information on 
demographics and participants' characteristics was collected by means of 
questionnaire.
RESULTS: Of the study population aged 6 years and older, 44.6% had detectable 
sIgEs, whereas 36.2% of children aged 1 to 5 years were sensitized to 1 or more 
allergens. Allergen-specific IgEs clustered into 7 groups that might have 
largely reflected biological cross-reactivity. Although sensitization to 
individual allergens and allergen types showed regional variation, the overall 
prevalence of sensitization did not differ across census regions, except in 
early childhood. In multivariate modeling young age, male sex, non-Hispanic 
black race/ethnicity, geographic location (census region), and reported pet 
avoidance measures were most consistently associated with IgE-mediated 
sensitization.
CONCLUSIONS: The overall prevalence of allergic sensitization does not vary 
across US census regions, except in early life, although allergen-specific 
sensitization differs based on sociodemographic and regional factors. Biological 
cross-reactivity might be an important but not the sole contributor to the 
clustering of allergen-specific IgEs.

BACKGROUND: Decreased 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations have been 
associated with an increased prevalence and severity of asthma and a lower 
response to inhaled corticosteroids.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine the association between serum 25(OH)D 
concentrations and asthma prevalence, severity, and response to asthma 
treatment.
DESIGN: Secondary analyses were conducted in 2 samples of adolescents 12-20 y of 
age: 1) NHANES 2001-2006 (n = 6487), a cross-sectional nationally representative 
sample of the US population, and 2) a cohort of inner-city adolescents with 
asthma managed prospectively for 46 wk with guidelines-based therapy in the 
Asthma Control Evaluation (ACE; n = 226) trial.
RESULTS: Mean (±SD) serum 25(OH)D concentrations in the NHANES and ACE samples 
were lower in African Americans than in non-African Americans (NHANES: 14.9 ± 
6.5 compared with 23.0 ± 8.4 ng/mL, P < 0.0001; ACE: 11.2 ± 6.9 compared with 
15.8 ± 7.1 ng/mL, P < 0.0001). In the NHANES sample, mean concentrations did not 
differ between participants without and with asthma (African Americans: 14.9 ± 
6.4 compared with 15.0 ± 6.6 ng/mL, respectively, P = 0.87; non-African 
Americans: 23.0 ± 8.5 compared with 23.6 ± 8.2 ng/mL, respectively, P = 0.16). 
In the ACE models that used either a predefined cutoff (<20 ng/mL) or linear 
regression, 25(OH)D concentrations showed either no relation or minor 
contradictory correlations with indicators of asthma severity, treatment 
requirements, spirometry, or atopy/inflammation.
CONCLUSION: In 2 samples of adolescents, overall serum 25(OH)D concentrations 
were low and were not consistently associated with the presence of asthma, 
multiple asthma characteristics, asthma morbidity, or response to treatment. The 
ACE trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT0011441.

BACKGROUND: Consistent performance of allergen assays is essential to ensure 
reproducibility of exposure assessments for investigations of asthma and 
occupational allergic disease. This study evaluated intra- and inter-laboratory 
reproducibility of a fluorescent multiplex array, which simultaneously measures 
eight indoor allergens in a single reaction well.
METHODS: A multi-center study was performed in nine laboratories in the US and 
Europe to determine the inter-laboratory variability of an 8-plex array for dust 
mite, cat, dog, rat, mouse and cockroach allergens. Aliquots of 151 dust extract 
samples were sent to participating centers and analyzed by each laboratory on 
three separate occasions. Agreement within and between laboratories was 
calculated by the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC).
RESULTS: Results were obtained for over 32,000 individual allergen measurements. 
Levels covered a wide range for all allergens from below the lower limit of 
detection (LLOD = 0.1-9.8 ng/ml) to higher than 6800 ng/ml for all allergens 
except Mus m 1, which was up to 1700 ng/ml. Results were reproducible within as 
well as between laboratories. Within laboratories, 94% of CCC were ≥ 0.90, and 
80% of intra-laboratory results fell within a 10% coefficient of variance (CV%). 
Results between laboratories also showed highly significant positive 
correlations for all allergens (~0.95, p<0.001). Overall means of results were 
comparable, and inter-laboratory CV% for all allergens except Rat n 1 ranged 
between 17.6% and 26.6%.
CONCLUSION: The data indicate that performance criteria for fluorescent 
multiplex array technology are reproducible within and between laboratories. 
Multiplex technology provides standardized and consistent allergen measurements 
that will streamline environmental exposure assessments in allergic disease.

Standardized studies examining environmental microbial exposure in populations 
at risk for asthma are necessary to improve our understanding of the role this 
factor plays in disease development. Here we describe studies aimed at 
developing guidelines for high-resolution culture-independent microbiome 
profiling, using a phylogenetic microarray (PhyloChip), of house dust samples in 
a cohort collected as part of the NIH-funded Inner City Asthma Consortium 
(ICAC). We demonstrate that though extracted DNA concentrations varied across 
dust samples, the majority produced sufficient 16S rRNA to be profiled by the 
array. Comparison of array and 454-pyrosequencing performed in parallel on a 
subset of samples, illustrated that increasingly deeper sequencing efforts 
validated greater numbers of array-detected taxa. Community composition 
agreement across samples exhibited a hierarchy in concordance, with the highest 
level of agreement in replicate array profiles followed by samples collected 
from adjacent 1×1 m(2) sites in the same room, adjacent sites with different 
sized sampling quadrants (1×1 and 2×2 m(2)), different sites within homes 
(living and bedroom) to lowest in living room samples collected from different 
homes. The guidelines for sample collection and processing in this pilot study 
extend beyond PhyloChip based studies of house-associated microbiota, and bear 
relevance for other microbiome profiling approaches such as next-generation 
sequencing.

BACKGROUND: Asthma severity is reflected in many aspects of the disease, 
including impairment and future risks, particularly for exacerbations. According 
to the Expert Panel Report 3: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of 
Asthma, however, to assess more comprehensively the severity of asthma the level 
of current treatment needed to maintain a level of control should be included.
OBJECTIVE: Development and validation of a new instrument, the Composite Asthma 
Severity Index (CASI), which can quantify disease severity by taking into 
account impairment, risk, and the amount of medication needed to maintain 
control. At present, there is no instrument available to measure and assess the 
multidimensional nature of asthma.
METHODS: Twenty-six established asthma investigators, who are part of the 
National Institutes of Health-supported Inner City Asthma Consortium, 
participated in a modified Delphi consensus process to identify and weight the 
dimensions of asthma. Factor analysis was performed to identify independent 
domains of asthma by using the Asthma Control Evaluation trial. CASI was 
validated by using the Inner City Anti-IgE Therapy for Asthma trial.
RESULTS: CASI scores include 5 domains: day symptoms and albuterol use, night 
symptoms and albuterol use, controller treatment, lung function measures, and 
exacerbations. At Asthma Control Evaluation trial enrollment, CASI ranged from 0 
to 17, with a mean of 6.2. CASI was stable, with minimal change in variance 
after 1 year of treatment. In external validation, CASI detected a 32% larger 
improvement than did symptoms alone.
CONCLUSION: CASI retained its discriminatory ability even with low levels of 
symptoms reported after months of guidelines-directed care. Thus, CASI has the 
ability to determine the level of asthma severity and provide a composite 
clinical characterization of asthma.

Hydroxyurea has enhanced the treatment for children with sickle cell anemia. The 
objectives of this study were to compare perioperative transfusions and outcomes 
for children taking hydroxyurea versus those not taking hydroxyurea. We 
retrospectively reviewed perioperative management and outcomes for 51 children 
with sickle cell anemia (HbSS genotype) who underwent surgery in our center 
between January 2003 and April 2008. Of the 51 patients, 30 (59%) were taking 
hydroxyurea and 21 (41%) were not taking hydroxyurea. Eight of 30 (27%) in the 
hydroxyurea group were not transfused preoperatively, 12 of 30 (40%) received a 
single transfusion and 10 of 30 (33%) received serial transfusions, compared 
with 1 of 21 (5%) children in the nonhydroxyurea group who was not transfused, 2 
of 21 (10%) who received a single transfusion and 18 of 21 (85%) who received 
serial transfusions or pheresis (P=0.004; for comparison across groups). One 
patient not taking hydroxyurea developed a delayed hyperhemolytic transfusion 
reaction, and 2 children taking hydroxyurea developed acute chest syndrome. 
Overall, children taking hydroxyurea had substantially fewer transfusions 
compared with children not taking hydroxyurea. Both groups of children had a low 
complication rate. Further research should be done to optimize perioperative 
management of children taking hydroxyurea.

BACKGROUND: Studies have demonstrated that IgE-binding cross-reactive epitopes 
between shrimp, cockroach, and house dust mite tropomyosins can account for the 
presence of detectable IgE to shrimp in patients with cockroach and dust mite 
allergies.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated the correlation between IgE-mediated sensitization to 
shrimp, cockroach, and dust mite in relation to allergen exposure in inner-city 
children.
METHODS: Five hundred four serum samples from the National Cooperative 
Inner-City Asthma Study were evaluated for specific IgE to shrimp, and the 
results were compared with specific IgE to cockroach (Blattella germanica) and 
dust mite (Dermatophagoides farinae). Associations between IgE sensitization to 
these allergens and environmental exposures were determined.
RESULTS: There was a strong positive correlation between shrimp, cockroach, and 
dust mite IgE levels. High exposure to cockroach (B germanica) in the home, 
particularly in the bedroom and television room, was significantly correlated 
with higher shrimp and cockroach IgE levels. In contrast, high exposure to dust 
mite in the home was highly correlated with IgE levels to D farinae but not with 
shrimp IgE levels. There is a synergistic relationship between cockroach IgE 
levels and exposure in predicting shrimp IgE levels.
CONCLUSIONS: For children with evidence of IgE-mediated sensitization to 
cockroach and shrimp, having high exposure to cockroach in the home can 
contribute to higher shrimp IgE levels, which might not correlate with clinical 
reactivity. Further patient evaluations with clinical histories of shrimp 
exposure and reactions, as well as oral food challenges, would have to be 
performed to confirm these findings.

Hydroxyurea is a safe and efficacious medication for children with sickle cell 
disease (SCD). Our objective was to compare health-related quality of life 
(HRQL) between children taking hydroxyurea and those not taking hydroxyurea. We 
conducted a retrospective cohort study of children with SCD who had completed 
the PedsQL 4.0 at Duke University Medical Center or the Midwest Sickle Cell 
Center. Our primary outcome was HRQL in children receiving hydroxyurea therapy 
compared with those not receiving hydroxyurea. One hundred and ninety-one 
children with SCD were included in the study. Children in the hydroxyurea group 
had higher self-reported Total PedsQL median scores than children in the no 
hydroxyurea group (P=0.04). Child self-reported physical functioning scores were 
significantly higher for children in the hydroxyurea group (P=0.01). In 
conclusion, children with SCD who received hydroxyurea therapy reported better 
overall HRQL and better physical HRQL than children who did not receive this 
therapy despite disease severity. Further research assessing the impact of 
hydroxyurea therapy on HRQL, such as prospective assessment over time, would aid 
in our understanding of the effectiveness of hydroxyurea for individual 
children. Ultimately, this may aid in decreasing the barriers to the use of 
hydroxyurea.

BACKGROUND: Research has underscored the effects of exposure and sensitization 
to allergens on the severity of asthma in inner-city children. It has also 
revealed the limitations of environmental remediation and guidelines-based 
therapy in achieving greater disease control.
METHODS: We enrolled inner-city children, adolescents, and young adults with 
persistent asthma in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group trial at multiple centers to assess the effectiveness of 
omalizumab, as compared with placebo, when added to guidelines-based therapy. 
The trial was conducted for 60 weeks, and the primary outcome was symptoms of 
asthma.
RESULTS: Among 419 participants who underwent randomization (at which point 73% 
had moderate or severe disease), omalizumab as compared with placebo 
significantly reduced the number of days with asthma symptoms, from 1.96 to 1.48 
days per 2-week interval, a 24.5% decrease (P<0.001). Similarly, omalizumab 
significantly reduced the proportion of participants who had one or more 
exacerbations from 48.8 to 30.3% (P<0.001). Improvements occurred with 
omalizumab despite reductions in the use of inhaled glucocorticoids and 
long-acting beta-agonists.
CONCLUSIONS: When added to a regimen of guidelines-based therapy for inner-city 
children, adolescents, and young adults, omalizumab further improved asthma 
control, nearly eliminated seasonal peaks in exacerbations, and reduced the need 
for other medications to control asthma. (Funded by the National Institute of 
Allergy and Infectious Diseases and Novartis; ClinicalTrials.gov number,

2005-2006 was the first population-based study to investigate levels of serum 
total and allergen-specific IgE in the general US population.
OBJECTIVE: We estimated the prevalence of allergy-related outcomes and examined 
relationships between serum IgE levels and these outcomes in a representative 
sample of the US population.
METHODS: Data for this cross-sectional analysis were obtained from NHANES 
2005-2006. Study subjects aged 6 years and older (n = 8086) had blood taken for 
measurement of total IgE and 19 specific IgE levels against common 
aeroallergens, including Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus fumigatus, Bermuda 
grass, birch, oak, ragweed, Russian thistle, rye grass, cat dander, cockroach, 
dog dander, dust mite (Dermatophagoides farinae and Dermatophagoides 
pteronyssinus), mouse and rat urine proteins, and selected foods (egg white, 
cow's milk, peanut, and shrimp). Serum samples were analyzed for total and 
allergen-specific IgE by using the Pharmacia CAP System. Information on 
allergy-related outcomes and demographics was collected by questionnaire.
RESULTS: In NHANES 2005-2006, 6.6% reported current hay fever, and 23.5% had 
current allergies. Allergy-related outcomes increased with increasing total IgE 
levels (adjusted odds ratios for a 10-fold increase in total IgE level of 1.86 
[95% CI, 1.44-2.41] for hay fever and 1.64 [95% CI, 1.41-1.91] for allergies). 
Increased levels of plant-, pet-, and mold-specific IgE contributed 
independently to allergy-related symptoms. The greatest increase in odds was 
observed for hay fever and plant-specific IgE (adjusted odds ratio, 4.75; 95% 
CI, 3.83-5.88).
CONCLUSION: In the US population self-reported allergy symptoms are most 
consistently associated with increased levels of plant-, pet-, and mold-specific 
IgE.

BACKGROUND: Obesity and asthma prevalence have both risen among children over 
the last several decades, and research efforts increasingly suggest that obesity 
is associated with asthma. Some, but not all, studies have shown that the effect 
of obesity on asthma is stronger among nonatopic individuals than among those 
with atopy. Systemic inflammation may be a factor in this relationship.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of obesity with atopic and nonatopic 
asthma among U.S. children and to assess the role of C-reactive protein.
DESIGN: Nationally representative data from the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES) were used to examine the relationship of weight to 
current asthma using logistic regression. Overweight was defined as ≥ 85th 
percentile of body mass index (BMI)-for-age and obesity was defined as ≥ 95th 
percentile of BMI-for-age. The presence of at least one positive 
allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) was used to stratify the relationship 
by atopic status in 2005-2006 data (n = 3387). Setting and Participants. 
Stratified, multistage probability sampling was used to identify survey 
participants. This analysis includes children ages 2-19 (n = 16,074) from the 
1999-2006 NHANES who have information on BMI and current asthma.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Self-report of doctor-diagnosed current asthma.
RESULTS: Obesity was significantly related to current asthma among children and 
adolescents (odds ratio [OR]: 1.68, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.33, 2.12). 
The association was stronger in nonatopic children (OR: 2.46, 95% CI: 1.21, 
5.02) than in atopic children (OR: 1.34, 95% CI: 0.70, 2.57) (interaction p 
value = .09). C-reactive protein levels were associated with current asthma in 
nonatopic children, but not after adjusting for BMI.
CONCLUSION: Excess weight in children is associated with higher rates of asthma, 
especially asthma that is not accompanied by allergic disease.

BACKGROUND: There is an association between adiposity and asthma prevalence, but 
the relationship to asthma control is unclear.
OBJECTIVES: We sought to understand the relationships among adiposity, sex, and 
asthma control in inner-city adolescents with asthma.
METHODS: We prospectively followed 368 adolescents with moderate-to-severe 
asthma (ages 12-20 years) living in 10 urban areas for 1 year. Asthma symptoms 
and exacerbations were recorded, and pulmonary function and exhaled nitric oxide 
levels were measured every 6 weeks. Adiposity measures (body mass index [BMI] 
and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometric scans) were made, and blood was collected 
for measurement of allergy markers, adiponectin, leptin, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and 
C-reactive protein levels.
RESULTS: More than 60% of female subjects and 50% of male subjects were above 
the 85th percentile of BMI for age. Higher BMI was associated with more symptom 
days (R = 0.18, P = .02) and exacerbations (R = 0.18, P = .06) among female 
subjects only. Adiponectin was inversely related to asthma symptoms (R = -0.18, 
P < .05) and exacerbations (R = -0.20, P < .05) and positively with 
FEV(1)/forced vital capacity ratio (R = 0.15, P < .05) in male subjects only 
independent of body size. There was no relationship between adiposity or 
adipokines and total IgE levels, blood eosinophil counts, and exhaled nitric 
oxide levels. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry provided little additional value 
in relating adiposity to asthma outcome in this population of adolescents.
CONCLUSION: Adiposity is associated with poorer asthma control in female 
subjects. Adiponectin is associated with improved asthma control in male 
subjects.

RATIONALE: Stress-elicited disruption of immunity begins in utero.
OBJECTIVES: Associations among prenatal maternal stress and cord blood 
mononuclear cell (CBMC) cytokine responses were prospectively examined in the 
Urban Environment and Childhood Asthma Study (n = 557 families).
METHODS: Prenatal maternal stress included financial hardship, difficult life 
circumstances, community violence, and neighborhood/block and housing 
conditions. Factor analysis produced latent variables representing three 
contexts: individual stressors and ecological-level strains (housing problems 
and neighborhood problems), which were combined to create a composite cumulative 
stress indicator. CBMCs were incubated with innate (lipopolysaccharide, 
polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotides, 
peptidoglycan) and adaptive (tetanus, dust mite, cockroach) stimuli, respiratory 
syncytial virus, phytohemagglutinin, or medium alone. Cytokines were measured 
using multiplex ELISAs. Using linear regression, associations among increasing 
cumulative stress and cytokine responses were examined, adjusting for 
sociodemographic factors, parity, season of birth, maternal asthma and steroid 
use, and potential pathway variables (prenatal smoking, birth weight for 
gestational age).
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Mothers were primarily minorities (Black [71%], 
Latino [19%]) with an income less than $15,000 (69%). Mothers with the highest 
cumulative stress were older and more likely to have asthma and deliver lower 
birth weight infants. Higher prenatal stress was related to increased IL-8 
production after microbial (CpG, PIC, peptidoglycan) stimuli and increased tumor 
necrosis factor-alpha to microbial stimuli (CpG, PIC). In the adaptive panel, 
higher stress was associated with increased IL-13 after dust mite stimulation 
and reduced phytohemagglutinin-induced IFN-gamma.
CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal stress was associated with altered innate and adaptive 
immune responses in CBMCs. Stress-induced perinatal immunomodulation may impact 
the expression of allergic disease in these children.

OBJECTIVES: To assess adherence to hydroxyurea therapy in children with sickle 
cell anemia (SCA), evaluate the association between adherence and hematologic 
profile, and identify barriers and facilitators of adherence.
STUDY DESIGN: Children with SCA (n=75) receiving hydroxyurea were recruited for 
a single-institution cross-sectional study. The primary outcome was association 
between treatment adherence and percent fetal hemoglobin (HbF).
RESULTS: Good adherence was estimated at 82% with visual analog scale, 84% with 
Morisky score, 85% with medical provider report, 77% with clinic visits, and 49% 
on the basis of pharmacy refills. Increase in HbF was moderately associated with 
good adherence as measured with the parent/proxy Morisky score (r=-0.39; 95% CI, 
-0.58-0.17; P < .01) and prescription refills (r=0.39; 95% CI, 0.16-0.57; P < 
.01). The number of pharmacy refills and the Morisky score explained 23% of the 
variation in HbF response.
CONCLUSIONS: Adherence was > or =75% with 4 of 5 measures. Pharmacy refills and 
the Modified Morisky Scale may be used to identify children at high risk for 
poor response because of non-adherence and children with good adherence with 
poor response because of individual pharmacodynamics. Future research should 
prospectively compare adherence measures and evaluate methods to improve 
treatment adherence.

BACKGROUND: Cholesterol exerts complex effects on inflammation. There has been 
little investigation of whether serum cholesterol is associated with asthma, an 
inflammatory airways disease with great public health impact.
OBJECTIVE: To determine relationships between levels of 3 serum cholesterol 
measures (total cholesterol [TC], high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], 
and non-HDL-C) and asthma/wheeze in a sample representative of the US 
population.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study of 7005 participants age >or=6 years from the 
2005 to 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
RESULTS: Serum TC and non-HDL-C were lower in patients with current asthma than 
in subjects without current asthma in the overall population (TC, 188.5 vs 192.2 
mg/dL; non-HDL-C, 133.9 vs 137.7 mg/dL; P < .05 for both), whereas HDL-C was not 
different. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) from multivariate logistic regression per 
1-SD increase of TC and non-HDL-C for current asthma were 0.92 (95% CI, 
0.86-0.98) and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.85-0.98), respectively. On racial/ethnic 
stratification, these relationships reflect marked reductions unique to Mexican 
Americans (MAs; TC, 171.4 vs 189.3 mg/dL; P < .001; OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.48-0.80; 
non-HDL-C, 119.8 vs 137.9 mg/dL; P < .001; OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.48-0.79). Among 
MAs, the adjusted OR for wheeze requiring medical attention was 0.57 (95% CI, 
0.43-0.75) for TC and 0.53 (95% CI, 0.33-0.85) for non-HDL-C. Relationships 
between cholesterol and asthma/wheeze were independent of body mass index and 
serum C-reactive protein, and similar between atopic and nonatopic participants.
CONCLUSION: Serum TC and non-HDL-C are inversely related to asthma in the US 
population, chiefly reflecting a relationship among MAs.

OBJECTIVE: This study examined externalizing and internalizing behavior problem 
trajectories as a function of both iron status in infancy and infant 
characteristics.
METHODS: A sample of 185 healthy Costa Rican children who either had chronic, 
severe iron deficiency or good iron status in infancy were followed for 19 
years.
RESULTS: Mother ratings of externalizing and internalizing problems from age 5 
to 11-14 years were higher for the chronic iron deficiency group compared with 
those with the good iron status. Iron deficiency in infancy predicted persisting 
externalizing problems over this time period, especially for those with low 
physical activity in infancy. Beyond adolescence, youth in the chronic iron 
deficiency group did not report more problems than those in the good iron group.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the importance of considering infant iron 
status along with early behavioral characteristics to better identify those 
children at greatest risk for persisting long-term behavior problems.

BACKGROUND: The inability to measure IgE-based sensitivity to all allergens has 
limited our understanding of what portion of asthma is related to IgE. Total IgE 
measurement can potentially overcome this limitation.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the association between total IgE levels and 
asthma.
METHODS: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2006 examined 
a representative sample of the US population 6 years of age and older.
RESULTS: The median total IgE level was 40.8 kU/L (interquartile range, 15.5-114 
kU/L). Total IgE levels varied with age, sex, race/ethnicity, serum cotinine 
level, body size, and socioeconomic status. The prevalence of current asthma was 
8.8%. The prevalence of atopy was 42.5%, as defined by 15 specific IgEs. The 
adjusted odds ratio (OR) for asthma with a 10-fold increase in total IgE level 
was 2.18 (95% CI, 1.66-2.87). Total IgE level predicted asthma only among atopic 
subjects (OR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.62-3.60) and not among nonatopic subjects (OR, 
1.11; 95% CI, 0.72-1.71; interaction P = .005). Among atopic subjects, the 
association between total IgE level and asthma became stronger as the number of 
positive specific IgE test results increased. Asthma was present at even the 
lowest levels of total IgE, regardless of atopic status. Approximately 92% of 
atopic subjects were identified by 6 specific IgEs, but to increase the 
identification to more than 99% required 11 specific IgEs.
CONCLUSION: Total IgE levels are associated with asthma only among persons who 
have positive results for at least 1 allergen-specific IgE. Asthma independent 
of IgE is not uncommon in the US population. The complete identification of 
atopic subjects in a population requires a large panel of allergen-specific 
IgEs.

BACKGROUND: With the expanding effort to provide guidelines-based therapy to 
adolescents with asthma, attention must be directed to evaluating which factors 
predict future asthma control when guidelines-based management is applied.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the role of fraction of exhaled nitric oxide in parts 
per billion, markers of allergic sensitization, airway inflammation, and 
measures of asthma severity in determining future risk of asthma symptoms and 
exacerbations in adolescents and young adults participating in the Asthma 
Control Evaluation study.
METHODS: Five hundred forty-six inner-city residents, ages 12 through 20 years, 
with persistent asthma were extensively evaluated at study entry for predictors 
of future symptoms and exacerbations over the subsequent 46 weeks, during which 
guidelines-based, optimal asthma management was offered. Baseline measurements 
included fraction of exhaled nitric oxide in parts per billion, total IgE, 
allergen-specific IgE, allergen skin test reactivity, asthma symptoms, lung 
function, peripheral blood eosinophils, and, for a subset, airway 
hyperresponsiveness and sputum eosinophils.
RESULTS: The baseline characteristics we examined accounted for only a small 
portion of the variance for future maximum symptom days and exacerbations--11.4% 
and 12.6%, respectively. Future exacerbations were somewhat predicted by asthma 
symptoms, albuterol use, previous exacerbations, and lung function, whereas 
maximum symptom days were predicted, also to a modest extent, by symptoms, 
albuterol use, and previous exacerbations, but not lung function.
CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that the usual predictors of future disease 
activity have little predictive power when applied to a highly adherent 
population with persistent asthma that is receiving guidelines-based care. Thus, 
new predictors need to be identified that will be able to measure the continued 
fluctuation of disease that persists in highly adherent, well-treated 
populations such as the one studied.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of both obesity and allergic disease has increased 
among children over the last several decades. Previous literature on the 
relationship between obesity and allergic disease has been inconsistent. It is 
not known whether systemic inflammation could be a factor in this relationship.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine the association of obesity with total and 
allergen-specific IgE levels and allergy symptoms in US children and adolescents 
and to assess the role of C-reactive protein.
METHODS: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data from 2005-2006 
included measurement of total and allergen-specific IgE levels and allergy 
questions. Overweight was defined as the 85th or greater to less than the 95th 
percentile of body mass index for age, and obesity was defined as the 95th 
percentile or greater. Linear and logistic regression models were used to 
examine the association of weight categories with total IgE levels, atopy, 
allergen-specific IgE levels, and allergy symptoms among youth aged 2 to 19 
years.
RESULTS: Geometric mean total IgE levels were higher among obese (geometric mean 
ratio, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.10-1.57) and overweight (ratio, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.02-1.54) 
children than among normal-weight children. The odds ratio (OR) for atopy (any 
positive specific IgE measurement) was increased in the obese children compared 
with that seen in those of normal weight; this association was driven largely by 
allergic sensitization to foods (OR for atopy, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.03-1.55]; OR for 
food sensitization, 1.59 [95% CI, 1.28-1.98]). C-reactive protein levels were 
associated with total IgE levels, atopy, and food sensitization.
CONCLUSIONS: Obesity might be a contributor to the increased prevalence of 
allergic disease in children, particularly food allergy. Systemic inflammation 
might play a role in the development of allergic disease.

BACKGROUND: Hydroxyurea improves laboratory parameters and prevents acute 
clinical complications of sickle cell anemia (SCA) in children and adults, but 
its effects on organ function remain incompletely defined.
METHODS: To assess the safety and efficacy of hydroxyurea in young children with 
SCA and to prospectively assess kidney and brain function, 14 young children 
(mean age 35 months) received hydroxyurea at a mean maximum tolerated dose (MTD) 
of 28 mg/kg/day.
RESULTS: After a mean of 25 months, expected laboratory effects included 
significant increases in hemoglobin, MCV and %HbF along with significant 
decreases in reticulocytes, absolute neutrophil count, and bilirubin. There was 
no significant increase in glomerular filtration rate by DTPA clearance or 
Schwartz estimate. Mean transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocity changes were -25.6 
cm/sec (P < 0.01) and -26.8 cm/sec (P < 0.05) in the right and left MCA vessels, 
respectively. At study exit, no child had conditional or abnormal TCD values, 
and none developed brain ischemic lesions or vasculopathy progression by 
MRI/MRA. Growth and neurocognitive scores were preserved and Impact-on-Family 
scores improved.
CONCLUSIONS: These pilot data indicate hydroxyurea at MTD is well-tolerated by 
both children and families, and may prevent chronic organ damage in young 
children with SCA.

BACKGROUND: Cryopreservation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells has been used 
to preserve and standardize immunologic measurements for multicenter studies, 
however, effects of cryopreservation on cytokine responses are incompletely 
understood. In designing immunologic studies for a new multicenter birth cohort 
study of childhood asthma, we performed a series of experiments to determine the 
effects of two different methods of cryopreservation on the cytokine responses 
of cord and peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
RESULTS: Paired samples of PBMC were processed freshly, or after 
cryopreservation in a Nalgene container (NC) or a controlled-rate freezer (CRF). 
Although there were some differences between the methods, cryopreservation 
inhibited PHA-induced IL-10 secretion and Der f 1-induced IL-2 secretion, and 
augmented PHA-induced IL-2 secretion and spontaneous secretion of TNF-alpha. In 
separate experiments, NC cryopreservation inhibited secretion of several 
cytokines (IL-13, IL-10, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha) by PHA-stimulated cord blood 
mononuclear cells. With the exception of PHA-induced IL-13, results from fresh 
and cryopreserved cord blood samples were not significantly correlated. Finally, 
in reproducibility studies involving processing of identical cell samples in up 
to 4 separate laboratories, variances in cytokine responses of fresh cells 
stimulated at separate sites did not exceed those in cryopreserved cells 
stimulated at a central site.
CONCLUSION: Collectively, these studies indicate that cryopreservation can 
affect mononuclear cell cytokine response profiles, and that IL-10 secretion and 
antigen-induced responses may be especially vulnerable. These studies also 
demonstrate that mononuclear cell responses can be standardized for performance 
in a small number of laboratories for multicenter studies, and underscore the 
importance of measuring reproducibility and of testing whether cryopreservation 
techniques alter specific immunologic outcomes.

This longitudinal study of the effects of iron deficiency in infancy assessed 
motor development over time in 185 healthy Costa Rican children who varied in 
iron status at 12-23 months. Longitudinal analyses (hierarchical linear 
modeling) used the Bayley Psychomotor Index before and both 1 week and 3 months 
after iron treatment in infancy and the Bruninks-Oseretsky Test of Motor 
Proficiency - long form at 5 years and short form at 11-14 years. Children with 
chronic severe iron deficiency in infancy had lower motor scores at the 
beginning of the study and a lower but parallel trajectory for motor scores 
through early adolescence. Thus, there was no evidence of catch-up in motor 
development, despite iron therapy in infancy that corrected iron deficiency 
anemia in all cases.

The iron status of African-American infants continues to be subject to debate. 
We characterized the iron status of 198 9-month-old inner-city infants (94% fed 
iron-fortified formula) using a comprehensive panel of measures and assessing 
lead and inflammation markers. The proportion with iron deficiency was 
calculated based on three approaches (> or = 2 abnormal iron measures with or 
without anemia for MCV model--NHANES II, ferritin model--NHANES III, or 
Sweden/Honduras study) and a promising new measure-body iron, calculated from 
ferritin and transferrin receptor (TfR). There were no sex differences for any 
iron measure. Hb < 110 g/l was observed in 25%; Hb < or = 105 g/l in 10.1%. Free 
erythrocyte protoporphyrin (FEP) values were elevated without elevated lead 
concentrations or an inflammatory response: mean FEP = 86.6 microg/dl red blood 
cells [75.5 micromol/mol heme]; 52.3% were > 80 microg/dl (1.42 micromol/l), 
almost half of which were accompanied by a second abnormal iron measure. The 
estimated prevalence of iron deficiency was 14.4, 5.3, and 2.5% for the MCV 
model, ferritin model, and Sweden/Honduras cutoffs, respectively, and 4.1% for 
body iron < 0 mg/kg. Regulation of iron storage is immature at < 1 year of age, 
making estimates of iron deficiency that depend on ferritin, including body 
iron, suspect in this age period. Thus, the "true" prevalence of iron deficiency 
could not be established with confidence due to major differences in the 
results, depending on the guidelines used. Functional indicators of poor iron 
status in young infants are urgently needed.

Serum prolactin may reflect CNS dopaminergic function. Because iron deficiency 
(ID) alters brain dopamine in rats, serum prolactin levels were previously 
investigated in infants with varied iron status. High serum prolactin levels 
correlated with behaviors typical of chronic ID. The objective of this study was 
to determine the effect of infant iron status on serum prolactin levels after a 
stressor in early adolescence. One hundred fifty-nine of 191 children enrolled 
in infancy (chronic ID, n = 46; good iron comparison group, n = 113) had serum 
prolactin measurements after catheter placement at 11-14 y of age. Serum 
prolactin levels were compared by sex, pubertal status and infant iron status 
and the pattern of change over time was compared by infant iron status 
controlling for pubertal stage and background factors. Males and less mature 
adolescents had lower serum prolactin concentrations than females and more 
mature adolescents. Controlling for these factors, the serum prolactin response 
pattern differed significantly by infant iron status. Serum prolactin declined 
earlier for the chronic ID group. In conclusion, an altered serum prolactin 
response pattern was observed 10 y after chronic ID in infancy and may suggest a 
long-lasting effect of ID on the regulation of prolactin.

OBJECTIVE: Breast-feeding is associated with better child development outcomes, 
but uncertainty remains primarily due to the close relationship between 
breast-feeding and socioeconomic status. This study assesses the issue in a low 
socioeconomic status sample where breast-feeding was close to universal.
METHODS: Seven hundred eighty-four Chilean children were followed longitudinally 
from infancy. All but four were initially breastfed, 40% nursed beyond 12 
months, and infant growth was normal. Child development was assessed at 5(1/2) 
years by a cognitive, language, and motor test battery. The duration of 
breast-feeding as the sole milk source was analyzed as a continuous variable, 
adjusting for a comprehensive set of background factors.
RESULTS: The relationship between breast-feeding and most 5(1/2)-year 
developmental outcomes was nonlinear, with poorer outcome for periods of 
breast-feeding as the sole milk source for <2 months or >8 months--statistically 
significant for language, motor, and one comprehensive cognitive test, with a 
suggestive trend for IQ.
CONCLUSIONS: The observed nonlinear relationships showed that breast-feeding as 
the sole milk source for <2 months or >8 months, compared with 2-8 months, was 
associated with poorer development in this sample. The latter finding requires 
replication in other samples where long breast-feeding is common and 
socioeconomic status is relatively homogeneous.

BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is relatively common in the third 
trimester of pregnancy, but causal associations with low birth weight and 
compromised neonatal iron status are difficult to establish in human 
populations.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine the effects of diet-induced IDA on 
intrauterine growth and neonatal iron status in an appropriate animal model for 
third-trimester IDA in women.
DESIGN: Hematologic and iron-status measures, pregnancy outcomes, and fetal and 
neonatal evaluations were compared between pregnant rhesus monkeys (n = 14) fed 
a diet containing 10 microg Fe/g diet from the time of pregnancy detection 
(gestation days 28-30) and controls (n = 24) fed 100 microg Fe/g diet.
RESULTS: By the third trimester, 79% of the iron-deprived dams and 29% of the 
control monkeys had a hemoglobin concentration <11 g/dL. There were also 
significant group differences in hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, 
transferrin saturation, serum ferritin, and serum iron. At birth, the newborns 
of monkeys iron-deprived during pregnancy had significantly lower hemoglobin, 
mean corpuscular volume, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin values and a lower 
ratio of erythroid to total colony-forming units in bone marrow than did the 
control newborns. Pregnancy weight gain did not differ significantly between the 
iron-deprived and control dams, and the fetuses and newborns of the 
iron-deprived dams were not growth retarded relative to the controls. Gestation 
length, the number of stillbirths, and neonatal neurobehavioral test scores did 
not differ significantly by diet group.
CONCLUSION: These data indicate that an inadequate intake of iron from the diet 
during pregnancy in rhesus monkeys can lead to compromised hematologic status of 
the neonate without indications of growth retardation or impaired neurologic 
function at birth.
