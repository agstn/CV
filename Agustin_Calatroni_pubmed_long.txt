TI  - Randomized trial of omalizumab (anti-IgE) for asthma in inner-city children.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Research has underscored the effects of exposure and sensitization to 
      allergens on the severity of asthma in inner-city children. It has also revealed the 
      limitations of environmental remediation and guidelines-based therapy in achieving 
      greater disease control. METHODS: We enrolled inner-city children, adolescents, and 
      young adults with persistent asthma in a randomized, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial at multiple centers to assess the 
      effectiveness of omalizumab, as compared with placebo, when added to 
      guidelines-based therapy. The trial was conducted for 60 weeks, and the primary 
      outcome was symptoms of asthma. RESULTS: Among 419 participants who underwent 
      randomization (at which point 73% had moderate or severe disease), omalizumab as 
      compared with placebo significantly reduced the number of days with asthma symptoms, 
      from 1.96 to 1.48 days per 2-week interval, a 24.5% decrease (P<0.001). Similarly, 
      omalizumab significantly reduced the proportion of participants who had one or more 
      exacerbations from 48.8 to 30.3% (P<0.001). Improvements occurred with omalizumab 
      despite reductions in the use of inhaled glucocorticoids and long-acting 
      beta-agonists. CONCLUSIONS: When added to a regimen of guidelines-based therapy for 
      inner-city children, adolescents, and young adults, omalizumab further improved 
      asthma control, nearly eliminated seasonal peaks in exacerbations, and reduced the 
      need for other medications to control asthma. (Funded by the National Institute of

AB  - BACKGROUND: Environmental exposures in early life appear to play an important role 
      in the pathogenesis of childhood asthma, but the potentially modifiable exposures 
      that lead to asthma remain uncertain. OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify early-life 
      environmental risk factors for childhood asthma in a birth cohort of high-risk 
      inner-city children. METHODS: We examined the relationship of prenatal and 
      early-life environmental factors to the occurrence of asthma at 7 years of age among 
      442 children. RESULTS: Higher house dust concentrations of cockroach, mouse, and cat 
      allergens in the first 3 years of life were associated with lower risk of asthma 
      (for cockroach allergen: odds ratio per interquartile range increase in 
      concentration, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.36-0.86; P < .01). House dust microbiome analysis 
      using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing identified 202 and 171 bacterial taxa that were 
      significantly (false discovery rate < 0.05) more or less abundant, respectively, in 
      the homes of children with asthma. A majority of these bacteria were significantly 
      correlated with 1 of more allergen concentrations. Other factors associated 
      significantly positively with asthma included umbilical cord plasma cotinine 
      concentration (odds ratio per geometric SD increase in concentration, 1.76; 95% CI, 
      1.00-3.09; P = .048) and maternal stress and depression scores. CONCLUSION: Among 
      high-risk inner-city children, higher indoor levels of pet or pest allergens in 
      infancy were associated with lower risk of asthma. The abundance of a number of 
      bacterial taxa in house dust was associated with increased or decreased asthma risk. 
      Prenatal tobacco smoke exposure and higher maternal stress and depression scores in 
      early life were associated with increased asthma risk.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Short-term targeted treatment can potentially prevent fall asthma 
      exacerbations while limiting therapy exposure. OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare (1) 
      omalizumab with placebo and (2) omalizumab with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) 
      boost with regard to fall exacerbation rates when initiated 4 to 6 weeks before 
      return to school. METHODS: A 3-arm, randomized, double-blind, double 
      placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial was conducted among inner-city 
      asthmatic children aged 6 to 17 years with 1 or more recent exacerbations 
      (clincaltrials.gov #NCT01430403). Guidelines-based therapy was continued over a 4- 
      to 9-month run-in phase and a 4-month intervention phase. In a subset the effects of 
      omalizumab on IFN-α responses to rhinovirus in PBMCs were examined. RESULTS: Before 
      the falls of 2012 and 2013, 727 children were enrolled, 513 were randomized, and 478 
      were analyzed. The fall exacerbation rate was significantly lower in the omalizumab 
      versus placebo arms (11.3% vs 21.0%; odds ratio [OR], 0.48; 95% CI, 0.25-0.92), but 
      there was no significant difference between omalizumab and ICS boost (8.4% vs 11.1%; 
      OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.33-1.64). In a prespecified subgroup analysis, among 
      participants with an exacerbation during the run-in phase, omalizumab was 
      significantly more efficacious than both placebo (6.4% vs 36.3%; OR, 0.12; 95% CI, 
      0.02-0.64) and ICS boost (2.0% vs 27.8%; OR, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.002-0.98). Omalizumab 
      improved IFN-α responses to rhinovirus, and within the omalizumab group, greater 
      IFN-α increases were associated with fewer exacerbations (OR, 0.14; 95% CI, 
      0.01-0.88). Adverse events were rare and similar among arms. CONCLUSIONS: Adding 
      omalizumab before return to school to ongoing guidelines-based care among inner-city 
      youth reduces fall asthma exacerbations, particularly among those with a recent 
      exacerbation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In infants, distinct nasopharyngeal bacterial microbiotas differentially 
      associate with the incidence and severity of acute respiratory tract infection and 
      childhood asthma development. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that distinct nasal airway 
      microbiota structures also exist in children with asthma and relate to clinical 
      outcomes. METHODS: Nasal secretion samples (n = 3122) collected after randomization 
      during the fall season from children with asthma (6-17 years, n = 413) enrolled in a 
      trial of omalizumab (anti-IgE) underwent 16S rRNA profiling. Statistical analyses 
      with exacerbation as the primary outcome and rhinovirus infection and respiratory 
      illnesses as secondary outcomes were performed. Using A549 epithelial cells, we 
      assessed nasal isolates of Moraxella, Staphylococcus, and Corynebacterium species 
      for their capacity to induce epithelial damage and inflammatory responses. RESULTS: 
      Six nasal airway microbiota assemblages, each dominated by Moraxella, 
      Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, Streptococcus, Alloiococcus, or Haemophilus 
      species, were observed. Moraxella and Staphylococcus species-dominated microbiotas 
      were most frequently detected and exhibited temporal stability. Nasal microbiotas 
      dominated by Moraxella species were associated with increased exacerbation risk and 
      eosinophil activation. Staphylococcus or Corynebacterium species-dominated 
      microbiotas were associated with reduced respiratory illness and exacerbation 
      events, whereas Streptococcus species-dominated assemblages increased the risk of 
      rhinovirus infection. Nasal microbiota composition remained relatively stable 
      despite viral infection or exacerbation; only a few taxa belonging to the dominant 
      genera exhibited relative abundance fluctuations during these events. In vitro, 
      Moraxella catarrhalis induced significantly greater epithelial damage and 
      inflammatory cytokine expression (IL-33 and IL-8) compared with other dominant nasal 
      bacterial isolates tested. CONCLUSION: Distinct nasal airway microbiotas of children 
      with asthma relate to the likelihood of exacerbation, rhinovirus infection, and 
      respiratory illnesses during the fall season.

      Asthma.

AB  - RATIONALE: Allergic inflammation has been linked to increased susceptibility to 
      viral illnesses, but it is unclear whether this association is causal. OBJECTIVES: 
      To test whether omalizumab treatment to reduce IgE would shorten the frequency and 
      duration of rhinovirus (RV) illnesses in children with allergic asthma. METHODS: In 
      the PROSE (Preventative Omalizumab or Step-up Therapy for Severe Fall Exacerbations) 
      study, we examined children with allergic asthma (aged 6-17 yr; n = 478) from 
      low-income census tracts in eight U.S. cities, and we analyzed virology for the 
      groups randomized to treatment with guidelines-based asthma care (n = 89) or add-on 
      omalizumab (n = 259). Weekly nasal mucus samples were analyzed for RVs, and 
      respiratory symptoms and asthma exacerbations were recorded over a 90-day period 
      during the fall seasons of 2012 or 2013. Adjusted illness rates (illnesses per 
      sample) by treatment arm were calculated using Poisson regression. MEASUREMENTS AND 
      MAIN RESULTS: RVs were detected in 97 (57%) of 171 exacerbation samples and 2,150 
      (36%) of 5,959 nonexacerbation samples (OR, 2.32; P < 0.001). Exacerbations were 
      significantly associated with detection of rhinovirus C (OR, 2.85; P < 0.001) and 
      rhinovirus A (OR, 2.92; P < 0.001), as well as, to a lesser extent, rhinovirus B 
      (OR, 1.98; P = 0.019). Omalizumab decreased the duration of RV infection (11.2 d vs. 
      12.4 d; P = 0.03) and reduced peak RV shedding by 0.4 log units (95% confidence 
      interval, -0.77 to -0.02; P = 0.04). Finally, omalizumab decreased the frequency of 
      RV illnesses (risk ratio, 0.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.49-0.84). CONCLUSIONS: In 
      children with allergic asthma, treatment with omalizumab decreased the duration of 
      RV infections, viral shedding, and the risk of RV illnesses. These findings provide 
      direct evidence that blocking IgE decreases susceptibility to RV infections and 
      illness. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01430403).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Atopy and viral respiratory tract infections synergistically promote 
      asthma exacerbations. IgE cross-linking inhibits critical virus-induced IFN-α 
      responses of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), which can be deficient in patients 
      with allergic asthma. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether reducing IgE levels 
      in vivo with omalizumab treatment increases pDC antiviral IFN-α responses in 
      inner-city children with asthma. METHODS: PBMCs and pDCs isolated from children with 
      exacerbation-prone asthma before and during omalizumab treatment were stimulated 
      ex vivo with rhinovirus and influenza in the presence or absence of IgE 
      cross-linking. IFN-α levels were measured in supernatants, and mRNA expression of 
      IFN-α pathway genes was determined by using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) in cell 
      pellets. FcεRIα protein levels and mRNA expression were measured in unstimulated 
      cells by using flow cytometry and qRT-PCR, respectively. Changes in these outcomes 
      and associations with clinical outcomes were analyzed, and statistical modeling was 
      used to identify risk factors for asthma exacerbations. RESULTS: Omalizumab 
      treatment increased rhinovirus- and influenza-induced PBMC and rhinovirus-induced 
      pDC IFN-α responses in the presence of IgE cross-linking and reduced pDC surface 
      FcεRIα expression. Omalizumab-induced reductions in pDC FcεRIα levels were 
      significantly associated with a lower asthma exacerbation rate during the outcome 
      period and correlated with increases in PBMC IFN-α responses. PBMC FcεRIα mRNA 
      expression measured on study entry significantly improved an existing model of 
      exacerbation prediction. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that omalizumab 
      treatment augments pDC IFN-α responses and attenuates pDC FcεRIα protein expression 
      and provide evidence that these effects are related. These results support a 
      potential mechanism underlying clinical observations that allergic sensitization is 
      associated with increased susceptibility to virus-induced asthma exacerbations.

TI  - The nonlesional skin surface distinguishes atopic dermatitis with food allergy as a 
      unique endotype.

AB  - Skin barrier dysfunction has been reported in both atopic dermatitis (AD) and food 
      allergy (FA). However, only one-third of patients with AD have FA. The purpose of 
      this study was to use a minimally invasive skin tape strip sampling method and a 
      multiomics approach to determine whether children with AD and FA (AD FA+) have 
      stratum corneum (SC) abnormalities that distinguish them from AD without FA (AD FA-) 
      and nonatopic (NA) controls. Transepidermal water loss was found to be increased in 
      AD FA+. Filaggrin and the proportion of ω-hydroxy fatty acid sphingosine ceramide 
      content in nonlesional skin of children with AD FA+ were substantially lower than in 
      AD FA- and NA skin. These abnormalities correlated with morphologic changes in 
      epidermal lamellar bilayer architecture responsible for barrier homeostasis. Shotgun 
      metagenomic studies revealed that the nonlesional skin of AD FA+ had increased 
      abundance of Staphylococcus aureus compared to NA. Increased expression of keratins 
      5, 14, and 16 indicative of hyperproliferative keratinocytes was observed in the SC 
      of AD FA+. The skin transcriptome of AD FA+ had increased gene expression for 
      dendritic cells and type 2 immune pathways. A network analysis revealed keratins 5, 
      14, and 16 were positively correlated with AD FA+, whereas filaggrin breakdown 
      products were negatively correlated with AD FA+. These data suggest that the most 
      superficial compartment of nonlesional skin in AD FA+ has unique properties 
      associated with an immature skin barrier and type 2 immune activation.

LID - 10.1164/rccm.201801-0190OC [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Characterization of patterns of wheezing and allergic sensitization in 
      early life may allow for identification of specific environmental exposures 
      impacting asthma development. OBJECTIVES: To define respiratory phenotypes in 
      inner-city children and their associations with early-life environmental exposures. 
      METHODS: Data were collected prospectively from 442 children in the URECA (Urban 
      Environment and Childhood Asthma) birth cohort through age 7 years, reflecting 
      symptoms (wheezing), aeroallergen sensitization, pulmonary function, and body mass 
      index. Latent class mixed models identified trajectories of wheezing, allergic 
      sensitization, and pulmonary function. Cluster analysis defined nonoverlapping 
      groups (termed phenotypes). Potential associations between phenotypes and early-life 
      environmental exposures were examined. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Five 
      phenotypes were identified and mainly differentiated by patterns of wheezing and 
      allergic sensitization (low wheeze/low atopy; low wheeze/high atopy; transient 
      wheeze/low atopy; high wheeze/low atopy; high wheeze/high atopy). Asthma was most 
      often present in the high-wheeze phenotypes, with greatest respiratory morbidity 
      among children with frequent wheezing and allergic sensitization. These phenotypes 
      differentially related to early-life exposures, including maternal stress and 
      depression, antenatal environmental tobacco smoke, house dust microbiome, and 
      allergen content (all P < 0.05). Prenatal smoke exposure, maternal stress, and 
      depression were highest in the high-wheeze/low-atopy phenotype. The 
      high-wheeze/high-atopy phenotype was associated with low household microbial 
      richness and diversity. Early-life aeroallergen exposure was low in high-wheeze 
      phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of wheezing, allergic sensitization, and lung 
      function identified five respiratory phenotypes among inner-city children. 
      Early-life environmental exposure to stress, depression, tobacco smoke, and indoor 
      allergens and microbes differentially associate with specific phenotypes.

      Population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although pets are found in more than 50% of US homes, the effect of 
      pet allergen exposure on asthma morbidity in the US population is not well 
      documented. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of dog and cat allergen exposures on 
      asthma morbidity in the US population. METHODS: The National Health and Nutrition 
      Examination Survey is a representative sample of civilian US population. Data on 
      asthma, dog and cat allergen levels in bedroom dust, as well as specific IgE to dog 
      and cat were analyzed for all participants 6 years or older. RESULTS: Pets are 
      common in the United States, with more that 50% of households having a dog or a cat 
      or both. The prevalence of allergic sensitization in the National Health and 
      Nutrition Examination Survey population was similar for dog and cat, with both being 
      approximately 12%. Among those who were sensitized, exposure to elevated levels of 
      pet allergens was associated with an increased prevalence of asthma and asthma 
      attacks. Indeed, 44.2% of the asthma attacks were attributable to exposure to high 
      levels of dog allergen in the bedroom among patients with asthma sensitive to dog 
      and 30.3% were attributable to cat allergen exposure among the comparable 
      cat-sensitive and exposed group. Projecting these results to the US population 
      indicates more than 1 million increased asthma attacks each year for the 
      dog-sensitive and exposed group and more than 500,000 increased asthma attacks for 
      the cat-sensitive and exposed population of patients with asthma. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Exposure to elevated levels of dog and cat allergens among those sensitized 
      individuals with asthma is associated with excess asthma attacks. Reducing 
      pet allergen exposures has the potential for a significant decrease in asthma 
      morbidity.

TI  - Can we predict fall asthma exacerbations? Validation of the seasonal asthma

AB  - BACKGROUND: A Seasonal Asthma Exacerbation Predictive Index (saEPI) was previously 
      reported based on 2 prior National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases 
      Inner City Asthma Consortium trials. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to validate the 
      saEPI in a separate trial designed to prevent fall exacerbations with omalizumab 
      therapy. METHODS: The saEPI and its components were analyzed to characterize those 
      who had an asthma exacerbation during the Preventative Omalizumab or Step-Up Therapy 
      for Fall Exacerbations (PROSE) study. We characterized those inner-city children 
      with and without asthma exacerbations in the fall period treated with 
      guidelines-based therapy (GBT) in the absence and presence of omalizumab. RESULTS: A 
      higher saEPI was associated with an exacerbation in both the GBT alone (P < .001; 
      area under the curve, 0.76) and the GBT + omalizumab group (P < .01; area under the 
      curve, 0.65). In the GBT group, younger age at recruitment, higher total IgE, higher 
      blood eosinophil percentage and number, and higher treatment step were associated 
      with those who had an exacerbation compared with those who did not. In the 
      GBT + omalizumab group, younger age at recruitment, increased eosinophil number, 
      recent exacerbation, and higher treatment step were also associated with those who 
      had an exacerbation. The saEPI was associated with a high negative predictive value 
      in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: An exacerbation in children treated with GBT with or 
      without omalizumab was associated with a higher saEPI along with higher markers of 
      allergic inflammation, treatment step, and a recent exacerbation. Those that 
      exacerbated on omalizumab had similar features with the exception of some markers of 
      allergic sensitization, indicating a need to develop better markers to predict poor 
      response to omalizumab therapy and alternative treatment strategies for children 
      with these risk factors. The saEPI was able to reliably predict those children 
      unlikely to have an asthma exacerbation in both groups.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Epigenetic marks are heritable, influenced by the environment, direct 
      the maturation of T lymphocytes, and in mice enhance the development of allergic 
      airway disease. Thus it is important to define epigenetic alterations in asthmatic 
      populations. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesize that epigenetic alterations in circulating 
      PBMCs are associated with allergic asthma. METHODS: We compared DNA methylation 
      patterns and gene expression in inner-city children with persistent atopic asthma 
      versus healthy control subjects by using DNA and RNA from PBMCs. Results were 
      validated in an independent population of asthmatic patients. RESULTS: Comparing 
      asthmatic patients (n = 97) with control subjects (n = 97), we identified 81 regions 
      that were differentially methylated. Several immune genes were hypomethylated in 
      asthma, including IL13, RUNX3, and specific genes relevant to T lymphocytes (TIGIT). 
      Among asthmatic patients, 11 differentially methylated regions were associated with 
      higher serum IgE concentrations, and 16 were associated with percent predicted FEV1. 
      Hypomethylated and hypermethylated regions were associated with increased and 
      decreased gene expression, respectively (P < 6 × 10(-12) for asthma and P < .01 for 
      IgE). We further explored the relationship between DNA methylation and gene 
      expression using an integrative analysis and identified additional candidates 
      relevant to asthma (IL4 and ST2). Methylation marks involved in T-cell maturation 
      (RUNX3), TH2 immunity (IL4), and oxidative stress (catalase) were validated in an 
      independent asthmatic cohort of children living in the inner city. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      results demonstrate that DNA methylation marks in specific gene loci are associated 
      with asthma and suggest that epigenetic changes might play a role in establishing 
      the immune phenotype associated with asthma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cockroach is one of the most important sources of indoor allergens and 
      can lead to IgE sensitization and development of rhinitis and asthma. OBJECTIVE: We 
      sought to perform a cockroach allergen component analysis to determine the allergens 
      and antibody levels and patterns of sensitization associated with asthma and 
      rhinitis. METHODS: Antibody (IgE, IgG, and IgG(4)) levels to total cockroach and 8 
      cockroach allergens were determined in 2 groups of cockroach-sensitized 10-year-old 
      children with (n = 19) or without (n = 28) asthma and rhinitis. Allergen-specific 
      antibody levels were measured in streptavidin ImmunoCAPs loaded with each of the 
      recombinant allergens from groups 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 11, and total 
      cockroach-specific IgE levels were measured with the i6 ImmunoCAP. RESULTS: IgE 
      antibody levels to cockroach allergens and extract, but not IgG or IgG(4) antibody 
      levels, differed between subjects with and without asthma and rhinitis. 
      Specifically, recognition of more cockroach allergens with higher allergen-specific 
      IgE levels was associated with disease. Variable patterns of sensitization with no 
      immunodominant allergens were found in both groups. There was a good correlation 
      between the sum of allergen-specific IgE and total cockroach IgE levels (r = 0.86, 
      P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Component analysis of 8 cockroach allergens revealed 
      significant differences in IgE reactivity associated with the presence of asthma and 
      rhinitis. Allergen-specific IgE titers and sensitization profiles were associated 
      with asthma and rhinitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Only some patients with peanut allergy undergoing oral immunotherapy 
      (OIT) achieve sustained clinical response. Basophil activation could provide a 
      functional surrogate of efficacy. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that changes in 
      basophil sensitivity and area under the curve (AUC) to the immunodominant allergen 
      Ara h 2 correlate with clinical responses to OIT. METHODS: Children with peanut 
      allergy aged 7 to 13 years were enrolled in a single-center, open-label peanut OIT 
      trial. Levels of specific immunoglobulins were measured throughout OIT. Peripheral 
      blood from multiple time points was stimulated in vitro with peanut allergens for 
      flow cytometric assessment of the percentage of CD63(hi) activated basophils. 
      RESULTS: Twenty-two of 30 subjects were successfully treated with OIT; after 
      avoidance, 9 achieved sustained unresponsiveness (SU), and 13 had transient 
      desensitization (TD). Basophil sensitivity, measured by using the dose that induces 
      50% of the maximal basophil response, to Ara h 2 stimulation decreased from baseline 
      in subjects with SU (after OIT, P = .0041; after avoidance, P = .0011). At 3 months 
      of OIT, basophil sensitivity in subjects with SU decreased from baseline compared 
      with that in subjects with TD (median, 18-fold vs 3-fold; P = .01), with a receiver 
      operating characteristic of 0.84 and optimal fold change of 4.9. Basophil AUC to Ara 
      h 2 was suppressed after OIT equally in subjects with SU and those with TD (P = .4). 
      After avoidance, basophil AUC rebounded in subjects with TD but not those with SU 
      (P < .001). Passively sensitized basophils suppressed with postavoidance SU plasma 
      had a lower AUC than TD plasma (6.4% vs 38.9%, P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Early 
      decreases in basophil sensitivity to Ara h 2 correlate with SU. Basophil AUC 
      rebounds after avoidance in subjects with TD. Therefore, different aspects of 
      basophil activation might be useful for monitoring of OIT efficacy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Allergy to German cockroach (CR) is common in urban environments and is 
      an important allergen in children with asthma. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesize that the 
      evolution of allergic sensitization and clinical disease is associated with distinct 
      patterns of allergen-specific T cell reactivity. To test this hypothesis, a subset 
      of high-risk inner-city children participating in the URECA (Urban Environment and 
      Childhood Asthma) birth cohort were selected to evaluate CR-specific T cell 
      reactivity from three distinct groups based on acquisition of aeroallergen 
      sensitivity from ages 2 to 10: low atopy with minimal to no sensitivity (n = 26), 
      early-onset allergic sensitization (n = 25) and late-onset allergic sensitization 
      (n = 25). METHODS: Using pools of previously identified CR-derived T cell epitopes, 
      we characterized the allergen-specific T cell response in these 76 subjects from 
      blood samples obtained at age 10. CR-specific production of IL-5, IFNγ and IL-10 was 
      measured by ELISPOT following two-week in vitro culture with CR extract. RESULTS: T 
      cell responses were significantly higher in the early-onset atopy group compared to 
      low atopy (P = 0.01), and a trend for higher cytokine production in the late onset 
      compared to the low atopy cohort was also observed (P = 0.06). T cell responses were 
      similar between early- and late-onset cohorts. Furthermore, a comparison of T cell 
      reactivity between asthmatic and non-asthmatic individuals revealed significantly 
      higher cytokine production in asthmatics compared to non-asthmatics (P = 0.02) 
      within both the CR-allergic and non-allergic cohorts. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL 
      RELEVANCE: In conclusion, the present study reports that higher T cell reactivity is 
      associated with allergen sensitization and asthma. Interestingly, no significant 
      difference in T cell reactivity was observed in allergic children with early-onset 
      versus late-onset atopy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bedroom allergen exposures contribute to allergic disease morbidity 
      because people spend considerable time in bedrooms, where they come into close 
      contact with allergen reservoirs. OBJECTIVE: We investigated participant and housing 
      characteristics, including sociodemographic, regional, and climatic factors, 
      associated with bedroom allergen exposures in a nationally representative sample of 
      the US population. METHODS: Data were obtained from National Health and Nutrition 
      Examination Survey 2005-2006. Information on participant and housing characteristics 
      was collected by using questionnaires and environmental assessments. Concentrations 
      of 8 indoor allergens (Alt a 1, Bla g 1, Can f 1, Fel d 1, Der f 1, Der p 1, Mus m 
      1, and Rat n 1) in dust vacuumed from nearly 7000 bedrooms were measured by using 
      immunoassays. Exposure levels were classified as increased based on percentile 
      (75th/90th) cutoffs. We estimated the burden of exposure to multiple allergens and 
      used multivariable logistic regression to identify independent predictors for each 
      allergen and household allergen burden. RESULTS: Almost all participants (>99%) had 
      at least 1 and 74.2% had 3 to 6 allergens detected. More than two thirds of 
      participants (72.9%) had at least 1 allergen and 18.2% had 3 or more allergens 
      exceeding increased levels. Although exposure variability showed significant 
      racial/ethnic and regional differences, high exposure burden to multiple allergens 
      was most consistently associated with the presence of pets and pests, living in 
      mobile homes/trailers and older and rental homes, and living in nonmetropolitan 
      areas. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to multiple allergens is common. Despite highly 
      variable exposures, bedroom allergen burden is strongly associated with the presence 
      of pets and pests.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multicenter randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for asthma management 
      that incorporate usual-care regimens could benefit from standardized application of 
      evidence-based guidelines. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate performance of a 
      computerized decision support tool, the Asthma Control Evaluation and Treatment 
      (ACET) Program, to standardize usual-care regimens for asthma management in RCTs. 
      METHODS: Children and adolescents with persistent uncontrolled asthma living in 
      urban census tracts were recruited into 3 multicenter RCTs (each with a usual-care 
      arm) between 2004 and 2014. A computerized decision support tool scored asthma 
      control and assigned an appropriate treatment step based on published guidelines. 
      Control-level determinants (symptoms, rescue medication use, pulmonary function 
      measure, and adherence estimates) were collected at visits and entered into the ACET 
      Program. Changes in control levels and treatment steps were examined during the 
      trials. RESULTS: At screening, more than half of the participants were rated as 
      having symptoms that were not controlled or poorly controlled. The proportion of 
      participants who gained good control between screening and randomization increased 
      significantly in all 3 trials. Between 51% and 70% had symptoms that were well 
      controlled by randomization. The proportion of well-controlled participants remained 
      constant or improved slightly from randomization until the last posttreatment visit. 
      Nighttime symptoms were the most common control-level determinant; there were few 
      (<1%) instances of complete overlap of factors. FEV(1) was the driver of 
      control-level assignment in 30% of determinations. CONCLUSION: The ACET Program 
      decision support tool facilitated standardized asthma assessment and treatment in 
      multicenter RCTs and was associated with attaining and maintaining good asthma 
      control in most participants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Children with asthma are at increased risk for experiencing health and 
      educational disparities because of increased school absence. School nurses are well 
      positioned to support asthma management and improve school attendance. OBJECTIVE: We 
      sought to implement and assess the effect of the Building Bridges for Asthma Care 
      Program on improving school attendance and measures of asthma control. METHODS: 
      Children with asthma (age, 5-14 years) in the Denver Public School System (n = 240) 
      and the Hartford Public School System (n = 223) were enrolled in the Building 
      Bridges Program during the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 school years and followed until 
      the end of the second school year. The primary outcome was school absence, with 
      secondary outcomes, including asthma control, measured based on Childhood Asthma 
      Control Test or the Asthma Control Test scores and rescue inhaler use. RESULTS: 
      Participants experienced a 22% absolute decrease in school absenteeism, the number 
      of children with an Asthma Control Test/Childhood Asthma Control Test score of less 
      than the control threshold of 20 decreased from 42.7% to 28.8%, and bronchodilator 
      use greater than 2 times per week decreased from 35.8% to 22.9% (all changes were 
      significant, P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Children enrolled in the Building Bridges for 
      Asthma Care Program experienced reduced school absence and improved asthma control.

TI  - Data-driven programmatic approach to analysis of basophil activation tests.
PG  - 667-673
LID - 10.1002/cyto.b.21537 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Conventional data analysis of flow cytometry-based basophil activation 
      testing requires repetitive, labor-intensive analysis that hampers efforts to 
      standardize testing for clinical applications. Using an open-source platform, we 
      developed and implemented a programmatic approach to the analysis of the basophil 
      activation test (BAT) by flow cytometry. METHODS: Using the BÜHLMANN FlowCAST® 
      assay, peripheral blood from peanut allergic patients undergoing oral immunotherapy 
      was incubated with peanut allergens (Arah1, Arah2, Arah6, whole peanut extract) and 
      stained with fluorescent antibodies to CCR3 and CD63 for the development of a 
      data-driven programmatic analysis using Bioconductor and R. Basophil identification 
      using clustering and classification was validated using manually gated comparisons 
      in an experimental subset. Reproducibility of CD63 upregulation set on unstimulated 
      or anti-FcERI stimulated basophils was compared. RESULTS: BAT analysis of 294 
      experiments was successful in 91.5% using the above approach, with a total of 7,166 
      individual basophil activation tests from 269 experiments. We estimate this 
      represents a net saving of 1340 min of labor by a skilled operator. Medium-based 
      gating correlated to respective manual gating more closely than anti-FcERI based 
      gating (R = 0.96 vs. R = 0.84, P < 0.001). Only 2% of the basophil activation 
      results were significantly different from manual gating. Quality measures of the 
      experiments and other measures of basophil activation were also provided by the 
      analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We present a novel data-driven flow cytometric platform for 
      the analysis of clinical basophil activation testing, providing a high throughput 
      objective approach to basophil activation analysis. © 2017 International Clinical

TI  - Development and validation of the Composite Asthma Severity Index--an outcome 
      measure for use in children and adolescents.
PG  - 694-701
LID - 10.1016/j.jaci.2011.12.962 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Asthma severity is reflected in many aspects of the disease, including 
      impairment and future risks, particularly for exacerbations. According to the Expert 
      Panel Report 3: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma, however, to 
      assess more comprehensively the severity of asthma the level of current treatment 
      needed to maintain a level of control should be included. OBJECTIVE: Development and 
      validation of a new instrument, the Composite Asthma Severity Index (CASI), which 
      can quantify disease severity by taking into account impairment, risk, and the 
      amount of medication needed to maintain control. At present, there is no instrument 
      available to measure and assess the multidimensional nature of asthma. METHODS: 
      Twenty-six established asthma investigators, who are part of the National Institutes 
      of Health-supported Inner City Asthma Consortium, participated in a modified Delphi 
      consensus process to identify and weight the dimensions of asthma. Factor analysis 
      was performed to identify independent domains of asthma by using the Asthma Control 
      Evaluation trial. CASI was validated by using the Inner City Anti-IgE Therapy for 
      Asthma trial. RESULTS: CASI scores include 5 domains: day symptoms and albuterol 
      use, night symptoms and albuterol use, controller treatment, lung function measures, 
      and exacerbations. At Asthma Control Evaluation trial enrollment, CASI ranged from 0 
      to 17, with a mean of 6.2. CASI was stable, with minimal change in variance after 1 
      year of treatment. In external validation, CASI detected a 32% larger improvement 
      than did symptoms alone. CONCLUSION: CASI retained its discriminatory ability even 
      with low levels of symptoms reported after months of guidelines-directed care. Thus, 
      CASI has the ability to determine the level of asthma severity and provide a 
      composite clinical characterization of asthma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Disadvantaged urban children have high rates of allergic diseases and 
      wheezing, which are diseases associated with type 2-biased immunity. OBJECTIVE: We 
      sought to determine whether environmental exposures in early life influence cytokine 
      responses that affect the development of recurrent wheezing illnesses and allergic 
      sensitization. METHODS: A birth cohort of 560 urban families was recruited from 
      neighborhoods with high rates of poverty, and 467 (83%) children were followed until 
      3 years of age. Cytokine responses were measured in blood cell samples obtained at 
      birth (cord blood) and ages 1 and 3 years. Cytokine responses were examined in 
      relation to personal characteristics and environmental exposures to allergens and 
      endotoxin and to the development of allergic sensitization and recurrent wheeze 
      assessed at age 3 years. RESULTS: Cytokine responses generally increased with age, 
      but responses at birth were poorly predictive for those at ages 1 and 3 years. 
      Exposure to certain allergens (cockroach, mouse, dust mite) was significantly 
      associated with enhanced cytokine responses at age 3 years, including IFN-α and 
      IL-10 responses to certain stimulants and responses to phytohemagglutinin. Regarding 
      the clinical outcomes, reduced LPS-induced IL-10 responses at birth were associated 
      with recurrent wheeze. In contrast, reduced respiratory syncytial virus-induced IL-8 
      responses and increased 5'-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3' (CpG)-induced IL-12p40 and 
      allergen-induced IL-4 responses were associated with atopy. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      findings suggest that diverse biologic exposures, including allergens and endotoxin, 
      in urban homes stimulate the development of cytokine responses in early life, and 
      that cytokine responses to specific microbial and viral stimuli are associated with 
      the development of allergic sensitization and recurrent wheeze.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Aged asthmatic patients experience increased morbidity and mortality. 
      Knowledge of the aging effect on airway inflammation and asthma control is limited. 
      OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare airway inflammation and its relationship to asthma 
      control in aged versus younger patients and determine whether differences are asthma 
      specific or caused by "inflamm-aging." METHODS: We performed a prospective study of 
      aged (>60 years) and younger (21-40 years) inner-city patients with asthma. After a 
      run-in period to control for inhaled corticosteroid use, induced sputum was 
      collected. Age-matched nonasthmatic control subjects were included to measure 
      age-related inflammatory changes. RESULTS: Aged (mean age, 67.9 ± 5.1 years; n = 35) 
      compared with younger (mean age, 30.8 ± 5.9 years; n = 37) asthmatic patients had 
      significantly worse asthma control and lower FEV(1). Aged asthmatic patients had 
      higher sputum neutrophil (30.5 × 10(4)/mL and 23.1%) and eosinophil (7.0 × 10(4)/mL 
      and 3.8%) numbers and percentages compared with younger patients (neutrophils, 
      13.0 × 10(4)/mL [P < .01] and 6.9% [P < .01]; eosinophils, 2.0 × 10(4)/mL [P < .01] 
      and 1.2% [P < .01]). Aged asthmatic patients had higher sputum IL-6 (P < .01) and 
      IL-8 (P = .01) levels. No significant inflammatory differences between aged and 
      younger control subjects were observed. In aged asthmatic patients increased sputum 
      IL-6 and macrophage inflammatory protein 3α/CCL20 levels were significantly 
      associated with decreased asthma control and increased sputum neutrophil numbers and 
      IL-1β, IL-6, and macrophage inflammatory protein 3α/CCL20 levels were associated 
      with hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: The inflammatory patterns of aged versus younger 
      asthmatic patients are associated with increased sputum neutrophil and eosinophil 
      values and cytokine levels related to neutrophil recruitment. Differences in airway 
      inflammation can contribute to diminished asthma control in the aged. Further 
      understanding of asthma pathophysiology in aged patients is needed to improve 
      management of this vulnerable population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Asthma exacerbations remain common, even in children and adolescents, 
      despite optimal medical management. Identification of host risk factors for 
      exacerbations is incomplete, particularly for seasonal episodes. OBJECTIVE: We 
      sought to define host risk factors for asthma exacerbations unique to their season 
      of occurrence. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of patients aged 6 to 
      20 years who comprised the control groups of the Asthma Control Evaluation study and 
      the Inner City Anti-IgE Therapy for Asthma study. Univariate and multivariate models 
      were constructed to determine whether patients' demographic and historical factors, 
      allergic sensitization, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide values, spirometric 
      measurements, asthma control, and treatment requirements were associated with 
      seasonal exacerbations. RESULTS: The analysis included 400 patients (54.5% male; 
      59.0% African American; median age, 13 years). Exacerbations occurred in 37.5% of 
      participants over the periods of observation and were most common in the fall (28.8% 
      of participants). In univariate analysis impaired pulmonary function was 
      significantly associated with greater odds of exacerbations for all seasons, as was 
      an exacerbation in the previous season for all seasons except spring. In 
      multivariate analysis exacerbation in the previous season was the strongest 
      predictor in fall and winter, whereas a higher requirement for inhaled 
      corticosteroids was the strongest predictor in spring and summer. The multivariate 
      models had the best predictive power for fall exacerbations (30.5% variance 
      attributed). CONCLUSIONS: Among a large cohort of inner-city children with asthma, 
      patients' risk factors for exacerbation vary by season. Thus information on 
      individual patients might be beneficial in strategies to prevent these seasonal 
      events.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) and food allergy (FA) are associated with skin 
      barrier dysfunction. OBJECTIVE: Skin biomarkers are needed for skin barrier 
      interventions studies. METHODS: In this study, skin tape strip (STS) samples were 
      collected from nonlesional skin of 62 children in AD FA+, AD FA-, and nonatopic 
      groups for mass spectrometry proteomic analysis. transepidermal water loss and 
      allergic sensitization were assessed. STS proteomic analysis results were validated 
      in an independent cohort of 41 adults with AD with and without FA versus nonatopic 
      controls. RESULTS: A group of 45 proteins was identified as a principal component 1 
      (PC1) with the highest expression in AD FA+ STSs. This novel set of STS proteins was 
      highly correlative to skin transepidermal water loss and allergic sensitization. PC1 
      proteins included keratin intermediate filaments; proteins associated with 
      inflammatory responses (S100 proteins, alarmins, protease inhibitors); and 
      glycolysis and antioxidant defense enzymes. Analysis of PC1 proteins expression in 
      an independent adult AD cohort validated differential expression of STS PC1 proteins 
      in the skin of adult patients with AD with the history of clinical reactions to 
      peanut. CONCLUSIONS: STS analysis of nonlesional skin of AD children identified a 
      cluster of proteins with the highest expression in AD FA+ children. The differential 
      expression of STS PC1 proteins was confirmed in a replicate cohort of adult AD 
      patients with FA to peanut, suggesting a unique STS proteomic endotype for AD FA+ 
      that persists into adulthood. Collectively, PC1 proteins are associated with 
      abnormalities in skin barrier integrity and may increase the risk of epicutaneous 
      sensitization to food allergens.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Environmental exposures to indoor allergens are major contributors to 
      asthma symptoms, particularly in inner cities. The effectiveness of household 
      allergen reduction as an adjunct to National Asthma Education Prevention Program 
      guideline-based pharmacologic therapy in asthma has not been prospectively studied. 
      OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of individualized allergen reduction on ability to 
      reduce asthma pharmacologic therapy over 40 weeks. METHODS: We performed a 
      randomized controlled trial to determine the effect of multifaceted indoor allergen 
      avoidance measures on the ability to reduce asthma controller therapy in adults and 
      children residing in New York City who were both sensitized and exposed to at least 
      1 indoor allergen. Asthma treatment and control were optimized in all subjects 
      before randomization. RESULTS: A total of 125 subjects were randomized to receive 
      individualized household allergen reduction and 122 received a sham intervention. 
      Subjects in the intervention group significantly reduced all measured allergen 
      levels (cat, dog, dust mite allergens in the bedroom, cockroach and mouse allergens 
      in the kitchen and bedroom); those in the control group reduced only dust mite and 
      mouse allergens in the bedroom and cockroach allergen in the kitchen. Participants 
      in the intervention arm reduced National Asthma Education Prevention Program-based 
      therapy from step 4.4 at randomization to 3.50 postintervention (range, 0-6); 
      participants in the control arm reduced medication from step 4.4 to 3.4 (P = .76). 
      There were no differences in other measured asthma outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Targeted 
      allergen avoidance measures do not allow for reduction in asthma pharmacologic 
      therapy compared with usual care in patients already receiving optimal controller 
      therapy.

TI  - Asthma control, adiposity, and adipokines among inner-city adolescents.
PG  - 584-92

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is an association between adiposity and asthma prevalence, but the 
      relationship to asthma control is unclear. OBJECTIVES: We sought to understand the 
      relationships among adiposity, sex, and asthma control in inner-city adolescents 
      with asthma. METHODS: We prospectively followed 368 adolescents with 
      moderate-to-severe asthma (ages 12-20 years) living in 10 urban areas for 1 year. 
      Asthma symptoms and exacerbations were recorded, and pulmonary function and exhaled 
      nitric oxide levels were measured every 6 weeks. Adiposity measures (body mass index 
      [BMI] and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometric scans) were made, and blood was 
      collected for measurement of allergy markers, adiponectin, leptin, TNF-alpha, IL-6, 
      and C-reactive protein levels. RESULTS: More than 60% of female subjects and 50% of 
      male subjects were above the 85th percentile of BMI for age. Higher BMI was 
      associated with more symptom days (R = 0.18, P = .02) and exacerbations (R = 0.18, P 
      = .06) among female subjects only. Adiponectin was inversely related to asthma 
      symptoms (R = -0.18, P < .05) and exacerbations (R = -0.20, P < .05) and positively 
      with FEV(1)/forced vital capacity ratio (R = 0.15, P < .05) in male subjects only 
      independent of body size. There was no relationship between adiposity or adipokines 
      and total IgE levels, blood eosinophil counts, and exhaled nitric oxide levels. 
      Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry provided little additional value in relating 
      adiposity to asthma outcome in this population of adolescents. CONCLUSION: Adiposity 
      is associated with poorer asthma control in female subjects. Adiponectin is 
      associated with improved asthma control in male subjects.

TI  - Peanut oral immunotherapy transiently expands circulating Ara h 2-specific B cells 
      with a homologous repertoire in unrelated subjects.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Peanut oral immunotherapy (PNOIT) induces persistent tolerance to peanut 
      in a subset of patients and induces specific antibodies that might play a role in 
      clinical protection. However, the contribution of induced antibody clones to 
      clinical tolerance in PNOIT is unknown. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that PNOIT 
      induces a clonal, allergen-specific B-cell response that could serve as a surrogate 
      for clinical outcomes. METHODS: We used a fluorescent Ara h 2 multimer for affinity 
      selection of Ara h 2-specific B cells and subsequent single-cell immunoglobulin 
      amplification. The diversity of related clones was evaluated by means of 
      next-generation sequencing of immunoglobulin heavy chains from circulating memory B 
      cells with 2x250 paired-end sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform. RESULTS: 
      Expression of class-switched antibodies from Ara h 2-positive cells confirms 
      enrichment for Ara h 2 specificity. PNOIT induces an early and transient expansion 
      of circulating Ara h 2-specific memory B cells that peaks at week 7. Ara h 
      2-specific sequences from memory cells have rates of nonsilent mutations consistent 
      with affinity maturation. The repertoire of Ara h 2-specific antibodies is 
      oligoclonal. Next-generation sequencing-based repertoire analysis of circulating 
      memory B cells reveals evidence for convergent selection of related sequences in 3 
      unrelated subjects, suggesting the presence of similar Ara h 2-specific B-cell 
      clones. CONCLUSIONS: Using a novel affinity selection approach to identify 
      antigen-specific B cells, we demonstrate that the early PNOIT-induced Ara h 
      2-specific B-cell receptor repertoire is oligoclonal and somatically hypermutated 
      and shares similar clonal groups among unrelated subjects consistent with convergent 
      selection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Wheezing illnesses cause major morbidity in infants and are frequent 
      precursors to asthma. OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine environmental factors 
      associated with recurrent wheezing in inner-city environments. METHODS: The Urban 
      Environment and Childhood Asthma study examined a birth cohort at high risk for 
      asthma (n = 560) in Baltimore, Boston, New York, and St Louis. Environmental 
      assessments included allergen exposure and, in a nested case-control study of 104 
      children, the bacterial content of house dust collected in the first year of life. 
      Associations were determined among environmental factors, aeroallergen 
      sensitization, and recurrent wheezing at age 3 years. RESULTS: Cumulative allergen 
      exposure over the first 3 years was associated with allergic sensitization, and 
      sensitization at age 3 years was related to recurrent wheeze. In contrast, 
      first-year exposure to cockroach, mouse, and cat allergens was negatively associated 
      with recurrent wheeze (odds ratio, 0.60, 0.65, and 0.75, respectively; P ≤ .01). 
      Differences in house dust bacterial content in the first year, especially reduced 
      exposure to specific Firmicutes and Bacteriodetes, was associated with atopy and 
      atopic wheeze. Exposure to high levels of both allergens and this subset of bacteria 
      in the first year of life was most common among children without atopy or wheeze. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In inner-city environments children with the highest exposure to 
      specific allergens and bacteria during their first year were least likely to have 
      recurrent wheeze and allergic sensitization. These findings suggest that concomitant 
      exposure to high levels of certain allergens and bacteria in early life might be 
      beneficial and suggest new preventive strategies for wheezing and allergic diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Consistent performance of allergen assays is essential to ensure 
      reproducibility of exposure assessments for investigations of asthma and 
      occupational allergic disease. This study evaluated intra- and inter-laboratory 
      reproducibility of a fluorescent multiplex array, which simultaneously measures 
      eight indoor allergens in a single reaction well. METHODS: A multi-center study was 
      performed in nine laboratories in the US and Europe to determine the 
      inter-laboratory variability of an 8-plex array for dust mite, cat, dog, rat, mouse 
      and cockroach allergens. Aliquots of 151 dust extract samples were sent to 
      participating centers and analyzed by each laboratory on three separate occasions. 
      Agreement within and between laboratories was calculated by the concordance 
      correlation coefficient (CCC). RESULTS: Results were obtained for over 32,000 
      individual allergen measurements. Levels covered a wide range for all allergens from 
      below the lower limit of detection (LLOD = 0.1-9.8 ng/ml) to higher than 6800 ng/ml 
      for all allergens except Mus m 1, which was up to 1700 ng/ml. Results were 
      reproducible within as well as between laboratories. Within laboratories, 94% of CCC 
      were ≥ 0.90, and 80% of intra-laboratory results fell within a 10% coefficient of 
      variance (CV%). Results between laboratories also showed highly significant positive 
      correlations for all allergens (~0.95, p<0.001). Overall means of results were 
      comparable, and inter-laboratory CV% for all allergens except Rat n 1 ranged between 
      17.6% and 26.6%. CONCLUSION: The data indicate that performance criteria for 
      fluorescent multiplex array technology are reproducible within and between 
      laboratories. Multiplex technology provides standardized and consistent allergen 
      measurements that will streamline environmental exposure assessments in allergic 
      disease.

TI  - Iron status of inner-city African-American infants.
PG  - 112-21
AB  - The iron status of African-American infants continues to be subject to debate. We 
      characterized the iron status of 198 9-month-old inner-city infants (94% fed 
      iron-fortified formula) using a comprehensive panel of measures and assessing lead 
      and inflammation markers. The proportion with iron deficiency was calculated based 
      on three approaches (> or = 2 abnormal iron measures with or without anemia for MCV 
      model--NHANES II, ferritin model--NHANES III, or Sweden/Honduras study) and a 
      promising new measure-body iron, calculated from ferritin and transferrin receptor 
      (TfR). There were no sex differences for any iron measure. Hb < 110 g/l was observed 
      in 25%; Hb < or = 105 g/l in 10.1%. Free erythrocyte protoporphyrin (FEP) values 
      were elevated without elevated lead concentrations or an inflammatory response: mean 
      FEP = 86.6 microg/dl red blood cells [75.5 micromol/mol heme]; 52.3% were > 80 
      microg/dl (1.42 micromol/l), almost half of which were accompanied by a second 
      abnormal iron measure. The estimated prevalence of iron deficiency was 14.4, 5.3, 
      and 2.5% for the MCV model, ferritin model, and Sweden/Honduras cutoffs, 
      respectively, and 4.1% for body iron < 0 mg/kg. Regulation of iron storage is 
      immature at < 1 year of age, making estimates of iron deficiency that depend on 
      ferritin, including body iron, suspect in this age period. Thus, the "true" 
      prevalence of iron deficiency could not be established with confidence due to major 
      differences in the results, depending on the guidelines used. Functional indicators 
      of poor iron status in young infants are urgently needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment regimens for omalizumab are guided by a dosing table that is 
      based on total serum IgE and body weight. Limited data exist about onset and offset 
      of omalizumab efficacy in children and adolescents or subgroups that most benefit 
      from treatment. OBJECTIVES: Post hoc analyses were conducted to (1) examine patient 
      characteristics of those eligible and ineligible for omalizumab, (2) describe onset 
      of effect after initiation of omalizumab and offset of treatment effect after 
      stopping therapy, and (3) determine whether the efficacy differs by age, asthma 
      severity, dosing regimen, and prespecified biomarkers. METHODS: Inner-city children 
      and adolescents with persistent allergic asthma were enrolled in the Inner-City 
      Anti-IgE Therapy for Asthma trial that compared omalizumab with placebo added to 
      guidelines-based therapy for 60 weeks. RESULTS: Two hundred ninety-three of 889 
      participants (33%) clinically suitable for omalizumab were ineligible for dosing 
      according to a modified dosing table specifying IgE level and body weight criteria. 
      Baseline symptoms were comparable among those eligible and ineligible to receive 
      omalizumab, but other characteristics (rate of health care utilization and skin test 
      results) differed. The time of onset of omalizumab effect was <30 days and time of 
      offset was between 30 and 120 days. No difference in efficacy was noted by age or 
      asthma severity, but high exhaled nitric oxide, blood eosinophils, and body mass 
      index predicted efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: A significant portion of children and 
      adolescents particularly suited for omalizumab because of asthma severity status may 
      be ineligible due to IgE >1300 IU/mL. Omalizumab reduced asthma symptoms and 
      exacerbations rapidly; features associated with efficacy can be identified to guide 
      patient selection.

LID - 10.1093/jpepsy/jsp065 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examined externalizing and internalizing behavior problem 
      trajectories as a function of both iron status in infancy and infant 
      characteristics. METHODS: A sample of 185 healthy Costa Rican children who either 
      had chronic, severe iron deficiency or good iron status in infancy were followed for 
      19 years. RESULTS: Mother ratings of externalizing and internalizing problems from 
      age 5 to 11-14 years were higher for the chronic iron deficiency group compared with 
      those with the good iron status. Iron deficiency in infancy predicted persisting 
      externalizing problems over this time period, especially for those with low physical 
      activity in infancy. Beyond adolescence, youth in the chronic iron deficiency group 
      did not report more problems than those in the good iron group. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      findings underscore the importance of considering infant iron status along with 
      early behavioral characteristics to better identify those children at greatest risk

TI  - Lack of a relation between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and asthma in 
      adolescents.
PG  - 1228-34
LID - 10.3945/ajcn.112.046961 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Decreased 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations have been 
      associated with an increased prevalence and severity of asthma and a lower response 
      to inhaled corticosteroids. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine the 
      association between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and asthma prevalence, severity, 
      and response to asthma treatment. DESIGN: Secondary analyses were conducted in 2 
      samples of adolescents 12-20 y of age: 1) NHANES 2001-2006 (n = 6487), a 
      cross-sectional nationally representative sample of the US population, and 2) a 
      cohort of inner-city adolescents with asthma managed prospectively for 46 wk with 
      guidelines-based therapy in the Asthma Control Evaluation (ACE; n = 226) trial. 
      RESULTS: Mean (±SD) serum 25(OH)D concentrations in the NHANES and ACE samples were 
      lower in African Americans than in non-African Americans (NHANES: 14.9 ± 6.5 
      compared with 23.0 ± 8.4 ng/mL, P < 0.0001; ACE: 11.2 ± 6.9 compared with 15.8 ± 7.1 
      ng/mL, P < 0.0001). In the NHANES sample, mean concentrations did not differ between 
      participants without and with asthma (African Americans: 14.9 ± 6.4 compared with 
      15.0 ± 6.6 ng/mL, respectively, P = 0.87; non-African Americans: 23.0 ± 8.5 compared 
      with 23.6 ± 8.2 ng/mL, respectively, P = 0.16). In the ACE models that used either a 
      predefined cutoff (<20 ng/mL) or linear regression, 25(OH)D concentrations showed 
      either no relation or minor contradictory correlations with indicators of asthma 
      severity, treatment requirements, spirometry, or atopy/inflammation. CONCLUSION: In 
      2 samples of adolescents, overall serum 25(OH)D concentrations were low and were not 
      consistently associated with the presence of asthma, multiple asthma 
      characteristics, asthma morbidity, or response to treatment. The ACE trial was 
      registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT0011441.

TI  - Allergy-related outcomes in relation to serum IgE: results from the National Health 
      and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2006.
PG  - 1226-35.e7
LID - 10.1016/j.jaci.2010.12.1106 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2006 
      was the first population-based study to investigate levels of serum total and 
      allergen-specific IgE in the general US population. OBJECTIVE: We estimated the 
      prevalence of allergy-related outcomes and examined relationships between serum IgE 
      levels and these outcomes in a representative sample of the US population. METHODS: 
      Data for this cross-sectional analysis were obtained from NHANES 2005-2006. Study 
      subjects aged 6 years and older (n = 8086) had blood taken for measurement of total 
      IgE and 19 specific IgE levels against common aeroallergens, including Alternaria 
      alternata, Aspergillus fumigatus, Bermuda grass, birch, oak, ragweed, Russian 
      thistle, rye grass, cat dander, cockroach, dog dander, dust mite (Dermatophagoides 
      farinae and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus), mouse and rat urine proteins, and 
      selected foods (egg white, cow's milk, peanut, and shrimp). Serum samples were 
      analyzed for total and allergen-specific IgE by using the Pharmacia CAP System. 
      Information on allergy-related outcomes and demographics was collected by 
      questionnaire. RESULTS: In NHANES 2005-2006, 6.6% reported current hay fever, and 
      23.5% had current allergies. Allergy-related outcomes increased with increasing 
      total IgE levels (adjusted odds ratios for a 10-fold increase in total IgE level of 
      1.86 [95% CI, 1.44-2.41] for hay fever and 1.64 [95% CI, 1.41-1.91] for allergies). 
      Increased levels of plant-, pet-, and mold-specific IgE contributed independently to 
      allergy-related symptoms. The greatest increase in odds was observed for hay fever 
      and plant-specific IgE (adjusted odds ratio, 4.75; 95% CI, 3.83-5.88). CONCLUSION: 
      In the US population self-reported allergy symptoms are most consistently associated 
      with increased levels of plant-, pet-, and mold-specific IgE.

TI  - Novel relationship of serum cholesterol with asthma and wheeze in the United States.
PG  - 967-74.e1-15
LID - 10.1016/j.jaci.2009.08.005 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cholesterol exerts complex effects on inflammation. There has been 
      little investigation of whether serum cholesterol is associated with asthma, an 
      inflammatory airways disease with great public health impact. OBJECTIVE: To 
      determine relationships between levels of 3 serum cholesterol measures (total 
      cholesterol [TC], high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], and non-HDL-C) and 
      asthma/wheeze in a sample representative of the US population. METHODS: 
      Cross-sectional study of 7005 participants age >or=6 years from the 2005 to 2006 
      National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. RESULTS: Serum TC and non-HDL-C 
      were lower in patients with current asthma than in subjects without current asthma 
      in the overall population (TC, 188.5 vs 192.2 mg/dL; non-HDL-C, 133.9 vs 137.7 
      mg/dL; P < .05 for both), whereas HDL-C was not different. Adjusted odds ratios 
      (ORs) from multivariate logistic regression per 1-SD increase of TC and non-HDL-C 
      for current asthma were 0.92 (95% CI, 0.86-0.98) and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.85-0.98), 
      respectively. On racial/ethnic stratification, these relationships reflect marked 
      reductions unique to Mexican Americans (MAs; TC, 171.4 vs 189.3 mg/dL; P < .001; OR, 
      0.62; 95% CI, 0.48-0.80; non-HDL-C, 119.8 vs 137.9 mg/dL; P < .001; OR, 0.62; 95% 
      CI, 0.48-0.79). Among MAs, the adjusted OR for wheeze requiring medical attention 
      was 0.57 (95% CI, 0.43-0.75) for TC and 0.53 (95% CI, 0.33-0.85) for non-HDL-C. 
      Relationships between cholesterol and asthma/wheeze were independent of body mass 
      index and serum C-reactive protein, and similar between atopic and nonatopic 
      participants. CONCLUSION: Serum TC and non-HDL-C are inversely related to asthma in 
      the US population, chiefly reflecting a relationship among MAs.

TI  - Diet-induced iron deficiency anemia and pregnancy outcome in rhesus monkeys.
PG  - 647-56
AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is relatively common in the third trimester 
      of pregnancy, but causal associations with low birth weight and compromised neonatal 
      iron status are difficult to establish in human populations. OBJECTIVE: The 
      objective was to determine the effects of diet-induced IDA on intrauterine growth 
      and neonatal iron status in an appropriate animal model for third-trimester IDA in 
      women. DESIGN: Hematologic and iron-status measures, pregnancy outcomes, and fetal 
      and neonatal evaluations were compared between pregnant rhesus monkeys (n = 14) fed 
      a diet containing 10 microg Fe/g diet from the time of pregnancy detection 
      (gestation days 28-30) and controls (n = 24) fed 100 microg Fe/g diet. RESULTS: By 
      the third trimester, 79% of the iron-deprived dams and 29% of the control monkeys 
      had a hemoglobin concentration <11 g/dL. There were also significant group 
      differences in hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, transferrin saturation, serum 
      ferritin, and serum iron. At birth, the newborns of monkeys iron-deprived during 
      pregnancy had significantly lower hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, and mean 
      corpuscular hemoglobin values and a lower ratio of erythroid to total colony-forming 
      units in bone marrow than did the control newborns. Pregnancy weight gain did not 
      differ significantly between the iron-deprived and control dams, and the fetuses and 
      newborns of the iron-deprived dams were not growth retarded relative to the 
      controls. Gestation length, the number of stillbirths, and neonatal neurobehavioral 
      test scores did not differ significantly by diet group. CONCLUSION: These data 
      indicate that an inadequate intake of iron from the diet during pregnancy in rhesus 
      monkeys can lead to compromised hematologic status of the neonate without 
      indications of growth retardation or impaired neurologic function at birth.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess adherence to hydroxyurea therapy in children with sickle cell 
      anemia (SCA), evaluate the association between adherence and hematologic profile, 
      and identify barriers and facilitators of adherence. STUDY DESIGN: Children with SCA 
      (n=75) receiving hydroxyurea were recruited for a single-institution cross-sectional 
      study. The primary outcome was association between treatment adherence and percent 
      fetal hemoglobin (HbF). RESULTS: Good adherence was estimated at 82% with visual 
      analog scale, 84% with Morisky score, 85% with medical provider report, 77% with 
      clinic visits, and 49% on the basis of pharmacy refills. Increase in HbF was 
      moderately associated with good adherence as measured with the parent/proxy Morisky 
      score (r=-0.39; 95% CI, -0.58-0.17; P < .01) and prescription refills (r=0.39; 95% 
      CI, 0.16-0.57; P < .01). The number of pharmacy refills and the Morisky score 
      explained 23% of the variation in HbF response. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence was > or =75% 
      with 4 of 5 measures. Pharmacy refills and the Modified Morisky Scale may be used to 
      identify children at high risk for poor response because of non-adherence and 
      children with good adherence with poor response because of individual 
      pharmacodynamics. Future research should prospectively compare adherence measures 
      and evaluate methods to improve treatment adherence.

TI  - A pilot study of hydroxyurea to prevent chronic organ damage in young children with 
      sickle cell anemia.
PG  - 609-15
LID - 10.1002/pbc.21738 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hydroxyurea improves laboratory parameters and prevents acute clinical 
      complications of sickle cell anemia (SCA) in children and adults, but its effects on 
      organ function remain incompletely defined. METHODS: To assess the safety and 
      efficacy of hydroxyurea in young children with SCA and to prospectively assess 
      kidney and brain function, 14 young children (mean age 35 months) received 
      hydroxyurea at a mean maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 28 mg/kg/day. RESULTS: After a 
      mean of 25 months, expected laboratory effects included significant increases in 
      hemoglobin, MCV and %HbF along with significant decreases in reticulocytes, absolute 
      neutrophil count, and bilirubin. There was no significant increase in glomerular 
      filtration rate by DTPA clearance or Schwartz estimate. Mean transcranial Doppler 
      (TCD) velocity changes were -25.6 cm/sec (P < 0.01) and -26.8 cm/sec (P < 0.05) in 
      the right and left MCA vessels, respectively. At study exit, no child had 
      conditional or abnormal TCD values, and none developed brain ischemic lesions or 
      vasculopathy progression by MRI/MRA. Growth and neurocognitive scores were preserved 
      and Impact-on-Family scores improved. CONCLUSIONS: These pilot data indicate 
      hydroxyurea at MTD is well-tolerated by both children and families, and may prevent 
      chronic organ damage in young children with SCA.

TI  - Breast-feeding and mental and motor development at 51/2 years.
PG  - 65-71
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Breast-feeding is associated with better child development outcomes, but 
      uncertainty remains primarily due to the close relationship between breast-feeding 
      and socioeconomic status. This study assesses the issue in a low socioeconomic 
      status sample where breast-feeding was close to universal. METHODS: Seven hundred 
      eighty-four Chilean children were followed longitudinally from infancy. All but four 
      were initially breastfed, 40% nursed beyond 12 months, and infant growth was normal. 
      Child development was assessed at 5(1/2) years by a cognitive, language, and motor 
      test battery. The duration of breast-feeding as the sole milk source was analyzed as 
      a continuous variable, adjusting for a comprehensive set of background factors. 
      RESULTS: The relationship between breast-feeding and most 5(1/2)-year developmental 
      outcomes was nonlinear, with poorer outcome for periods of breast-feeding as the 
      sole milk source for <2 months or >8 months--statistically significant for language, 
      motor, and one comprehensive cognitive test, with a suggestive trend for IQ. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The observed nonlinear relationships showed that breast-feeding as the 
      sole milk source for <2 months or >8 months, compared with 2-8 months, was 
      associated with poorer development in this sample. The latter finding requires 
      replication in other samples where long breast-feeding is common and socioeconomic 
      status is relatively homogeneous.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Allergic sensitization is an important risk factor for the development 
      of atopic disease. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 
      2005-2006 provides the most comprehensive information on IgE-mediated sensitization 
      in the general US population. OBJECTIVE: We investigated clustering, 
      sociodemographic, and regional patterns of allergic sensitization and examined risk 
      factors associated with IgE-mediated sensitization. METHODS: Data for this 
      cross-sectional analysis were obtained from NHANES 2005-2006. Participants aged 1 
      year or older (n = 9440) were tested for serum specific IgEs (sIgEs) to inhalant and 
      food allergens; participants 6 years or older were tested for 19 sIgEs, and children 
      aged 1 to 5 years were tested for 9 sIgEs. Serum samples were analyzed by using the 
      ImmunoCAP System. Information on demographics and participants' characteristics was 
      collected by means of questionnaire. RESULTS: Of the study population aged 6 years 
      and older, 44.6% had detectable sIgEs, whereas 36.2% of children aged 1 to 5 years 
      were sensitized to 1 or more allergens. Allergen-specific IgEs clustered into 7 
      groups that might have largely reflected biological cross-reactivity. Although 
      sensitization to individual allergens and allergen types showed regional variation, 
      the overall prevalence of sensitization did not differ across census regions, except 
      in early childhood. In multivariate modeling young age, male sex, non-Hispanic black 
      race/ethnicity, geographic location (census region), and reported pet avoidance 
      measures were most consistently associated with IgE-mediated sensitization. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The overall prevalence of allergic sensitization does not vary across 
      US census regions, except in early life, although allergen-specific sensitization 
      differs based on sociodemographic and regional factors. Biological cross-reactivity 
      might be an important but not the sole contributor to the clustering of 
      allergen-specific IgEs.

AB  - Standardized studies examining environmental microbial exposure in populations at 
      risk for asthma are necessary to improve our understanding of the role this factor 
      plays in disease development. Here we describe studies aimed at developing 
      guidelines for high-resolution culture-independent microbiome profiling, using a 
      phylogenetic microarray (PhyloChip), of house dust samples in a cohort collected as 
      part of the NIH-funded Inner City Asthma Consortium (ICAC). We demonstrate that 
      though extracted DNA concentrations varied across dust samples, the majority 
      produced sufficient 16S rRNA to be profiled by the array. Comparison of array and 
      454-pyrosequencing performed in parallel on a subset of samples, illustrated that 
      increasingly deeper sequencing efforts validated greater numbers of array-detected 
      taxa. Community composition agreement across samples exhibited a hierarchy in 
      concordance, with the highest level of agreement in replicate array profiles 
      followed by samples collected from adjacent 1×1 m(2) sites in the same room, 
      adjacent sites with different sized sampling quadrants (1×1 and 2×2 m(2)), different 
      sites within homes (living and bedroom) to lowest in living room samples collected 
      from different homes. The guidelines for sample collection and processing in this 
      pilot study extend beyond PhyloChip based studies of house-associated microbiota, 
      and bear relevance for other microbiome profiling approaches such as next-generation 
      sequencing.

TI  - Differences in health-related quality of life in children with sickle cell disease 
      receiving hydroxyurea.

AB  - Hydroxyurea is a safe and efficacious medication for children with sickle cell 
      disease (SCD). Our objective was to compare health-related quality of life (HRQL) 
      between children taking hydroxyurea and those not taking hydroxyurea. We conducted a 
      retrospective cohort study of children with SCD who had completed the PedsQL 4.0 at 
      Duke University Medical Center or the Midwest Sickle Cell Center. Our primary 
      outcome was HRQL in children receiving hydroxyurea therapy compared with those not 
      receiving hydroxyurea. One hundred and ninety-one children with SCD were included in 
      the study. Children in the hydroxyurea group had higher self-reported Total PedsQL 
      median scores than children in the no hydroxyurea group (P=0.04). Child 
      self-reported physical functioning scores were significantly higher for children in 
      the hydroxyurea group (P=0.01). In conclusion, children with SCD who received 
      hydroxyurea therapy reported better overall HRQL and better physical HRQL than 
      children who did not receive this therapy despite disease severity. Further research 
      assessing the impact of hydroxyurea therapy on HRQL, such as prospective assessment 
      over time, would aid in our understanding of the effectiveness of hydroxyurea for 
      individual children. Ultimately, this may aid in decreasing the barriers to the use 
      of hydroxyurea.

AB  - Hydroxyurea has enhanced the treatment for children with sickle cell anemia. The 
      objectives of this study were to compare perioperative transfusions and outcomes for 
      children taking hydroxyurea versus those not taking hydroxyurea. We retrospectively 
      reviewed perioperative management and outcomes for 51 children with sickle cell 
      anemia (HbSS genotype) who underwent surgery in our center between January 2003 and 
      April 2008. Of the 51 patients, 30 (59%) were taking hydroxyurea and 21 (41%) were 
      not taking hydroxyurea. Eight of 30 (27%) in the hydroxyurea group were not 
      transfused preoperatively, 12 of 30 (40%) received a single transfusion and 10 of 30 
      (33%) received serial transfusions, compared with 1 of 21 (5%) children in the 
      nonhydroxyurea group who was not transfused, 2 of 21 (10%) who received a single 
      transfusion and 18 of 21 (85%) who received serial transfusions or pheresis 
      (P=0.004; for comparison across groups). One patient not taking hydroxyurea 
      developed a delayed hyperhemolytic transfusion reaction, and 2 children taking 
      hydroxyurea developed acute chest syndrome. Overall, children taking hydroxyurea had 
      substantially fewer transfusions compared with children not taking hydroxyurea. Both 
      groups of children had a low complication rate. Further research should be done to 
      optimize perioperative management of children taking hydroxyurea.

TI  - Correlation of specific IgE to shrimp with cockroach and dust mite exposure and 
      sensitization in an inner-city population.
PG  - 834-7
LID - 10.1016/j.jaci.2011.07.045 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies have demonstrated that IgE-binding cross-reactive epitopes 
      between shrimp, cockroach, and house dust mite tropomyosins can account for the 
      presence of detectable IgE to shrimp in patients with cockroach and dust mite 
      allergies. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the correlation between IgE-mediated 
      sensitization to shrimp, cockroach, and dust mite in relation to allergen exposure 
      in inner-city children. METHODS: Five hundred four serum samples from the National 
      Cooperative Inner-City Asthma Study were evaluated for specific IgE to shrimp, and 
      the results were compared with specific IgE to cockroach (Blattella germanica) and 
      dust mite (Dermatophagoides farinae). Associations between IgE sensitization to 
      these allergens and environmental exposures were determined. RESULTS: There was a 
      strong positive correlation between shrimp, cockroach, and dust mite IgE levels. 
      High exposure to cockroach (B germanica) in the home, particularly in the bedroom 
      and television room, was significantly correlated with higher shrimp and cockroach 
      IgE levels. In contrast, high exposure to dust mite in the home was highly 
      correlated with IgE levels to D farinae but not with shrimp IgE levels. There is a 
      synergistic relationship between cockroach IgE levels and exposure in predicting 
      shrimp IgE levels. CONCLUSIONS: For children with evidence of IgE-mediated 
      sensitization to cockroach and shrimp, having high exposure to cockroach in the home 
      can contribute to higher shrimp IgE levels, which might not correlate with clinical 
      reactivity. Further patient evaluations with clinical histories of shrimp exposure 
      and reactions, as well as oral food challenges, would have to be performed to 
      confirm these findings.

TI  - Effects of iron deficiency in infancy on patterns of motor development over time.
PG  - 821-38
AB  - This longitudinal study of the effects of iron deficiency in infancy assessed motor 
      development over time in 185 healthy Costa Rican children who varied in iron status 
      at 12-23 months. Longitudinal analyses (hierarchical linear modeling) used the 
      Bayley Psychomotor Index before and both 1 week and 3 months after iron treatment in 
      infancy and the Bruninks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency - long form at 5 years 
      and short form at 11-14 years. Children with chronic severe iron deficiency in 
      infancy had lower motor scores at the beginning of the study and a lower but 
      parallel trajectory for motor scores through early adolescence. Thus, there was no 
      evidence of catch-up in motor development, despite iron therapy in infancy that 
      corrected iron deficiency anemia in all cases.

TI  - Prenatal maternal stress and cord blood innate and adaptive cytokine responses in an 
      inner-city cohort.
PG  - 25-33
LID - 10.1164/rccm.200904-0637OC [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Stress-elicited disruption of immunity begins in utero. OBJECTIVES: 
      Associations among prenatal maternal stress and cord blood mononuclear cell (CBMC) 
      cytokine responses were prospectively examined in the Urban Environment and 
      Childhood Asthma Study (n = 557 families). METHODS: Prenatal maternal stress 
      included financial hardship, difficult life circumstances, community violence, and 
      neighborhood/block and housing conditions. Factor analysis produced latent variables 
      representing three contexts: individual stressors and ecological-level strains 
      (housing problems and neighborhood problems), which were combined to create a 
      composite cumulative stress indicator. CBMCs were incubated with innate 
      (lipopolysaccharide, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, cytosine-phosphate-guanine 
      dinucleotides, peptidoglycan) and adaptive (tetanus, dust mite, cockroach) stimuli, 
      respiratory syncytial virus, phytohemagglutinin, or medium alone. Cytokines were 
      measured using multiplex ELISAs. Using linear regression, associations among 
      increasing cumulative stress and cytokine responses were examined, adjusting for 
      sociodemographic factors, parity, season of birth, maternal asthma and steroid use, 
      and potential pathway variables (prenatal smoking, birth weight for gestational 
      age). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Mothers were primarily minorities (Black [71%], 
      Latino [19%]) with an income less than $15,000 (69%). Mothers with the highest 
      cumulative stress were older and more likely to have asthma and deliver lower birth 
      weight infants. Higher prenatal stress was related to increased IL-8 production 
      after microbial (CpG, PIC, peptidoglycan) stimuli and increased tumor necrosis 
      factor-alpha to microbial stimuli (CpG, PIC). In the adaptive panel, higher stress 
      was associated with increased IL-13 after dust mite stimulation and reduced 
      phytohemagglutinin-induced IFN-gamma. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal stress was associated 
      with altered innate and adaptive immune responses in CBMCs. Stress-induced perinatal 
      immunomodulation may impact the expression of allergic disease in these children.

TI  - Asthma morbidity among inner-city adolescents receiving guidelines-based therapy: 
      role of predictors in the setting of high adherence.
PG  - 213-21, 221.e1
LID - 10.1016/j.jaci.2009.05.036 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the expanding effort to provide guidelines-based therapy to 
      adolescents with asthma, attention must be directed to evaluating which factors 
      predict future asthma control when guidelines-based management is applied. 
      OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the role of fraction of exhaled nitric oxide in parts per 
      billion, markers of allergic sensitization, airway inflammation, and measures of 
      asthma severity in determining future risk of asthma symptoms and exacerbations in 
      adolescents and young adults participating in the Asthma Control Evaluation study. 
      METHODS: Five hundred forty-six inner-city residents, ages 12 through 20 years, with 
      persistent asthma were extensively evaluated at study entry for predictors of future 
      symptoms and exacerbations over the subsequent 46 weeks, during which 
      guidelines-based, optimal asthma management was offered. Baseline measurements 
      included fraction of exhaled nitric oxide in parts per billion, total IgE, 
      allergen-specific IgE, allergen skin test reactivity, asthma symptoms, lung 
      function, peripheral blood eosinophils, and, for a subset, airway 
      hyperresponsiveness and sputum eosinophils. RESULTS: The baseline characteristics we 
      examined accounted for only a small portion of the variance for future maximum 
      symptom days and exacerbations--11.4% and 12.6%, respectively. Future exacerbations 
      were somewhat predicted by asthma symptoms, albuterol use, previous exacerbations, 
      and lung function, whereas maximum symptom days were predicted, also to a modest 
      extent, by symptoms, albuterol use, and previous exacerbations, but not lung 
      function. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that the usual predictors of future 
      disease activity have little predictive power when applied to a highly adherent 
      population with persistent asthma that is receiving guidelines-based care. Thus, new 
      predictors need to be identified that will be able to measure the continued 
      fluctuation of disease that persists in highly adherent, well-treated populations 
      such as the one studied.

TI  - Total IgE levels and asthma prevalence in the US population: results from the 
      National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2006.
PG  - 447-53
LID - 10.1016/j.jaci.2009.06.011 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The inability to measure IgE-based sensitivity to all allergens has 
      limited our understanding of what portion of asthma is related to IgE. Total IgE 
      measurement can potentially overcome this limitation. OBJECTIVE: We sought to 
      determine the association between total IgE levels and asthma. METHODS: The National 
      Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2006 examined a representative sample 
      of the US population 6 years of age and older. RESULTS: The median total IgE level 
      was 40.8 kU/L (interquartile range, 15.5-114 kU/L). Total IgE levels varied with 
      age, sex, race/ethnicity, serum cotinine level, body size, and socioeconomic status. 
      The prevalence of current asthma was 8.8%. The prevalence of atopy was 42.5%, as 
      defined by 15 specific IgEs. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for asthma with a 10-fold 
      increase in total IgE level was 2.18 (95% CI, 1.66-2.87). Total IgE level predicted 
      asthma only among atopic subjects (OR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.62-3.60) and not among 
      nonatopic subjects (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.72-1.71; interaction P = .005). Among atopic 
      subjects, the association between total IgE level and asthma became stronger as the 
      number of positive specific IgE test results increased. Asthma was present at even 
      the lowest levels of total IgE, regardless of atopic status. Approximately 92% of 
      atopic subjects were identified by 6 specific IgEs, but to increase the 
      identification to more than 99% required 11 specific IgEs. CONCLUSION: Total IgE 
      levels are associated with asthma only among persons who have positive results for 
      at least 1 allergen-specific IgE. Asthma independent of IgE is not uncommon in the 
      US population. The complete identification of atopic subjects in a population 
      requires a large panel of allergen-specific IgEs.

TI  - Standardization and performance evaluation of mononuclear cell cytokine secretion 
      assays in a multicenter study.
PG  - 29
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cryopreservation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells has been used to 
      preserve and standardize immunologic measurements for multicenter studies, however, 
      effects of cryopreservation on cytokine responses are incompletely understood. In 
      designing immunologic studies for a new multicenter birth cohort study of childhood 
      asthma, we performed a series of experiments to determine the effects of two 
      different methods of cryopreservation on the cytokine responses of cord and 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells. RESULTS: Paired samples of PBMC were processed 
      freshly, or after cryopreservation in a Nalgene container (NC) or a controlled-rate 
      freezer (CRF). Although there were some differences between the methods, 
      cryopreservation inhibited PHA-induced IL-10 secretion and Der f 1-induced IL-2 
      secretion, and augmented PHA-induced IL-2 secretion and spontaneous secretion of 
      TNF-alpha. In separate experiments, NC cryopreservation inhibited secretion of 
      several cytokines (IL-13, IL-10, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha) by PHA-stimulated cord blood 
      mononuclear cells. With the exception of PHA-induced IL-13, results from fresh and 
      cryopreserved cord blood samples were not significantly correlated. Finally, in 
      reproducibility studies involving processing of identical cell samples in up to 4 
      separate laboratories, variances in cytokine responses of fresh cells stimulated at 
      separate sites did not exceed those in cryopreserved cells stimulated at a central 
      site. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these studies indicate that cryopreservation can 
      affect mononuclear cell cytokine response profiles, and that IL-10 secretion and 
      antigen-induced responses may be especially vulnerable. These studies also 
      demonstrate that mononuclear cell responses can be standardized for performance in a 
      small number of laboratories for multicenter studies, and underscore the importance 
      of measuring reproducibility and of testing whether cryopreservation techniques 
      alter specific immunologic outcomes.

TI  - Iron deficiency in infancy predicts altered serum prolactin response 10 years later.
PG  - 513-7
AB  - Serum prolactin may reflect CNS dopaminergic function. Because iron deficiency (ID) 
      alters brain dopamine in rats, serum prolactin levels were previously investigated 
      in infants with varied iron status. High serum prolactin levels correlated with 
      behaviors typical of chronic ID. The objective of this study was to determine the 
      effect of infant iron status on serum prolactin levels after a stressor in early 
      adolescence. One hundred fifty-nine of 191 children enrolled in infancy (chronic ID, 
      n = 46; good iron comparison group, n = 113) had serum prolactin measurements after 
      catheter placement at 11-14 y of age. Serum prolactin levels were compared by sex, 
      pubertal status and infant iron status and the pattern of change over time was 
      compared by infant iron status controlling for pubertal stage and background 
      factors. Males and less mature adolescents had lower serum prolactin concentrations 
      than females and more mature adolescents. Controlling for these factors, the serum 
      prolactin response pattern differed significantly by infant iron status. Serum 
      prolactin declined earlier for the chronic ID group. In conclusion, an altered serum 
      prolactin response pattern was observed 10 y after chronic ID in infancy and may 
      suggest a long-lasting effect of ID on the regulation of prolactin.

TI  - Association of childhood obesity with atopic and nonatopic asthma: results from the 
      National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2006.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity and asthma prevalence have both risen among children over the 
      last several decades, and research efforts increasingly suggest that obesity is 
      associated with asthma. Some, but not all, studies have shown that the effect of 
      obesity on asthma is stronger among nonatopic individuals than among those with 
      atopy. Systemic inflammation may be a factor in this relationship. OBJECTIVE: To 
      examine the association of obesity with atopic and nonatopic asthma among U.S. 
      children and to assess the role of C-reactive protein. DESIGN: Nationally 
      representative data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
      (NHANES) were used to examine the relationship of weight to current asthma using 
      logistic regression. Overweight was defined as ≥ 85th percentile of body mass index 
      (BMI)-for-age and obesity was defined as ≥ 95th percentile of BMI-for-age. The 
      presence of at least one positive allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) was used 
      to stratify the relationship by atopic status in 2005-2006 data (n = 3387). Setting 
      and Participants. Stratified, multistage probability sampling was used to identify 
      survey participants. This analysis includes children ages 2-19 (n = 16,074) from the 
      1999-2006 NHANES who have information on BMI and current asthma. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURE: Self-report of doctor-diagnosed current asthma. RESULTS: Obesity was 
      significantly related to current asthma among children and adolescents (odds ratio 
      [OR]: 1.68, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.33, 2.12). The association was stronger 
      in nonatopic children (OR: 2.46, 95% CI: 1.21, 5.02) than in atopic children (OR: 
      1.34, 95% CI: 0.70, 2.57) (interaction p value = .09). C-reactive protein levels 
      were associated with current asthma in nonatopic children, but not after adjusting 
      for BMI. CONCLUSION: Excess weight in children is associated with higher rates of 
      asthma, especially asthma that is not accompanied by allergic disease.

TI  - Association of obesity with IgE levels and allergy symptoms in children and

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of both obesity and allergic disease has increased among 
      children over the last several decades. Previous literature on the relationship 
      between obesity and allergic disease has been inconsistent. It is not known whether 
      systemic inflammation could be a factor in this relationship. OBJECTIVE: We sought 
      to examine the association of obesity with total and allergen-specific IgE levels 
      and allergy symptoms in US children and adolescents and to assess the role of 
      C-reactive protein. METHODS: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data 
      from 2005-2006 included measurement of total and allergen-specific IgE levels and 
      allergy questions. Overweight was defined as the 85th or greater to less than the 
      95th percentile of body mass index for age, and obesity was defined as the 95th 
      percentile or greater. Linear and logistic regression models were used to examine 
      the association of weight categories with total IgE levels, atopy, allergen-specific 
      IgE levels, and allergy symptoms among youth aged 2 to 19 years. RESULTS: Geometric 
      mean total IgE levels were higher among obese (geometric mean ratio, 1.31; 95% CI, 
      1.10-1.57) and overweight (ratio, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.02-1.54) children than among 
      normal-weight children. The odds ratio (OR) for atopy (any positive specific IgE 
      measurement) was increased in the obese children compared with that seen in those of 
      normal weight; this association was driven largely by allergic sensitization to 
      foods (OR for atopy, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.03-1.55]; OR for food sensitization, 1.59 [95% 
      CI, 1.28-1.98]). C-reactive protein levels were associated with total IgE levels, 
      atopy, and food sensitization. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity might be a contributor to the 
      increased prevalence of allergic disease in children, particularly food allergy. 
      Systemic inflammation might play a role in the development of allergic disease.

TI  - Lower influenza-specific cell-mediated immune responses in individuals with atopic 
      dermatitis compared with healthy controls.
PG  - 1-9
LID - 10.1080/21645515.2020.1747374 [doi]
AB  - In a sub-study of a clinical trial (NCT01737710) investigating the immunogenicity of 
      trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) administered intradermally or 
      intramuscularly to individuals with atopic dermatitis (AD), we assessed T cell and 
      antigen-presenting cell (APC) responses to influenza B in AD and Non-AD controls. 
      The comparison of IFN-γ ELISpot in 58 AD and 31 Non-AD showed lower responses in AD 
      pre-vaccination. Pre-vaccination, AD also had lower Th2 responses and less 
      inflammatory cytokine production by APC measured by flow cytometry and cytokine 
      levels in culture supernatants. AD also had lower Th1 and Th2 responses to 
      nonspecific anti-CD3/anti-CD28-stimulation, but these were not significantly 
      correlated with the influenza-specific responses, suggesting a primary role for the 
      APC in the decreased influenza-specific T cell responses. Multivariate modeling of 
      influenza-specific responses pre-vaccination with influenza-specific antibody titers 
      and IFN-γ ELISpot as outcome measures identified several T cell and APC subsets that 
      negatively or positively predicted protective responses to the vaccine. However, 
      none of the functional differences between AD and Non-AD had high predictive value 
      on adaptive responses to influenza vaccine, which was in agreement with the overall 
      similar responses to the vaccine in the parent clinical trial.

TI  - Expression quantitative trait locus fine mapping of the 17q12-21 asthma locus in 
      African American children: a genetic association and gene expression study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: African ancestry is associated with a higher prevalence and greater 
      severity of asthma than European ancestries, yet genetic studies of the most common 
      locus associated with childhood-onset asthma, 17q12-21, in African Americans have 
      been inconclusive. The aim of this study was to leverage both the phenotyping of the 
      Children's Respiratory and Environmental Workgroup (CREW) birth cohort consortium, 
      and the reduced linkage disequilibrium in African Americans, to fine map the 
      17q12-21 locus. METHODS: We first did a genetic association study and meta-analysis 
      using 17q12-21 tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for childhood-onset asthma 
      in 1613 European American and 870 African American children from the CREW 
      consortium. Nine tag SNPs were selected based on linkage disequilibrium patterns at 
      17q12-21 and their association with asthma, considering the effect allele under an 
      additive model (0, 1, or 2 effect alleles). Results were meta-analysed with publicly 
      available summary data from the EVE consortium (on 4303 European American and 3034 
      African American individuals) for seven of the nine SNPs of interest. Subsequently, 
      we tested for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) among the SNPs associated 
      with childhood-onset asthma and the expression of 17q12-21 genes in resting 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 85 African American CREW children 
      and in upper airway epithelial cells from 246 African American CREW children; and in 
      lower airway epithelial cells from 44 European American and 72 African American 
      adults from a case-control study of asthma genetic risk in Chicago (IL, USA). 
      FINDINGS: 17q12-21 SNPs were broadly associated with asthma in European Americans. 
      Only two SNPs (rs2305480 in gasdermin-B [GSDMB] and rs8076131 in ORMDL sphingolipid 
      biosynthesis regulator 3 [ORMDL3]) were associated with asthma in African Americans, 
      at a Bonferroni-corrected threshold of p<0·0055 (for rs2305480_G, odds ratio [OR] 
      1·36 [95% CI 1·12-1·65], p=0·0014; and for rs8076131_A, OR 1·37 [1·13-1·67], 
      p=0·0010). In upper airway epithelial cells from African American children, genotype 
      at rs2305480 was the most significant eQTL for GSDMB (eQTL effect size [β] 1·35 [95% 
      CI 1·25-1·46], p<0·0001), and to a lesser extent showed an eQTL effect for post-GPI 
      attachment to proteins phospholipase 3 (β 1·15 [1·08-1·22], p<0·0001). No SNPs were 
      eQTLs for ORMDL3. By contrast, in PBMCs, the five core SNPs were associated only 
      with expression of GSDMB and ORMDL3. Genotype at rs12936231 (in zona pellucida 
      binding protein 2) showed the strongest associations across both genes (for GSDMB, 
      eQTLβ 1·24 [1·15-1·32], p<0·0001; and for ORMDL3 (β 1·19 [1·12-1·24], p<0·0001). The 
      eQTL effects of rs2305480 on GSDMB expression were replicated in lower airway cells 
      from African American adults (β 1·29 [1·15-1·44], p<0·0001). INTERPRETATION: Our 
      study suggests that SNPs regulating GSDMB expression in airway epithelial cells have 
      a major role in childhood-onset asthma, whereas SNPs regulating the expression 
      levels of 17q12-21 genes in resting blood cells are not central to asthma risk. Our 
      genetic and gene expression data in African Americans and European Americans 
      indicated GSDMB to be the leading candidate gene at this important asthma locus.

TI  - Aeroallergen Sensitization, Serum IgE, and Eosinophilia as Predictors of Response to 
      Omalizumab Therapy During the Fall Season Among Children with Persistent Asthma.
LID - S2213-2198(20)30414-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jaip.2020.03.051 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Perennial aeroallergen sensitization is associated with greater asthma 
      morbidity and is required for treatment with omalizumab. OBJECTIVE: To investigate 
      the predictive relationship between the number of aeroallergen sensitizations, total 
      serum IgE, and serum eosinophil count, and response to omalizumab in children and 
      adolescents with asthma treated during the fall season. METHODS: This analysis 
      includes inner-city patients with persistent asthma and recent exacerbations aged 
      6-20 years comprising the placebo- and omalizumab-treated groups in 2 completed 
      randomized clinical trials, the Inner-City Anti-IgE Therapy for Asthma study and the 
      Preventative Omalizumab or Step-Up Therapy for Fall Exacerbations study. Logistic 
      regression modeled the relationship between greater degrees of markers of allergic 
      inflammation and the primary outcome of fall season asthma exacerbations. RESULTS: 
      The analysis included 761 participants who were 62% male and 59% African American 
      with a median age of 10 years. Fall asthma exacerbations were significantly higher 
      in children with greater numbers of aeroallergen-specific sensitizations in the 
      placebo group (odds ratio [OR], 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-1.60; P < 
      .01), but not in the omalizumab-treated children (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.91-1.28; P = 
      .37), indicating a significant differential effect (P < .01). Likewise, there was a 
      differential effect of omalizumab treatment in children with greater baseline total 
      serum IgE levels (P < .01) or greater baseline serum eosinophil counts (P < .01). 
      Multiple aeroallergen sensitization was the best predictor of response to 
      omalizumab; treated participants sensitized to ≥4 different groups of aeroallergens 
      had a 51% reduction in the odds of a fall exacerbation (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.30-0.81; 
      P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: In preventing fall season asthma exacerbations, treatment 
      with omalizumab was most beneficial in children with a greater degree of allergic 
      inflammation.
